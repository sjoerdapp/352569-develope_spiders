The online report features extensive disclosure of Apache's performance in governance, economics, environmental stewardship, health and safety, workforce development and community engagement. The report is available at  www.apachecorp.com/Sustainability . \n \n       \n             \n               \n                 Apache Corporation (NYSE/Nasdaq: APA) has released its 2018 Sustainability Report. The online report features extensive disclosure of Apache's performance in governance, economics, environmental stewardship, health and safety, workforce development and community engagement. The report is available at www.apachecorp.com/Sustainability. \n               \n         \n   John J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president, said, \u201cAt Apache, we understand that our company\u2019s success hinges upon our ability to produce lasting benefits for all stakeholders, including our investors, our employees and the communities in which we operate. To accomplish this, we are building for the future sustainably by investing in innovative operational approaches that deliver environmental, social and financial returns.\u201d \n Among the highlights, the 2018 report: \n Provides increased transparency on Apache's most material sustainability issues  - Apache undertook a materiality analysis in 2017 to identify the issues that are most important to our stakeholders. Based on this analysis, the company is already reporting on all the issues stakeholders rank at the highest level of importance. In this report, Apache increased the level of disclosure on many of these topics, including water use and sourcing; water quality and wastewater management; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use; sustainability; health, safety and environment (HSE); social issue management; regulation and compliance; and risk management. \n   Highlights Apache\u2019s efforts to foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement  - The featured innovation section outlines Apache\u2019s efforts to explore and implement new and better technologies and streamline processes companywide. For instance, Apache worked to apply advanced data analytics to enhance our drilling performance results and reduce operational costs; develop innovative ways to recycle and reuse produced water; and improve seismic surveying technology to better locate and unlock oil and gas reserves. \n   Provides an in-depth update about our work in  Alpine High  - The report details how Apache is protecting local resources, implementing best management practices and coordinating with key community leaders to ensure the safe and responsible development of its new multidecade resource play,  Alpine High . \n   Addresses stakeholders' most frequently asked questions  - The report contains a special section that answers stakeholders' most frequently asked questions. The section provides concise yet thorough answers about how Apache is addressing these issues and points readers to more detailed, related content throughout the report. \n The report also highlights Apache's performance in key sustainability areas, including: \n Improving health and safety  - Since 2013, Apache has reduced safety incidents for employees and contractors by lowering our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) by 41 percent and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate by 50 percent. \n   Reducing methane emissions  - Apache is on track to meet its goal to reduce methane emissions intensity to 0.36 percent by 2025. In 2017, the company's global methane emissions intensity was 0.43 percent, a 9 percent reduction from 2016. \n   Using alternatives to fresh water  - In 2017, only 2 percent of Apache's water withdrawals were fresh water. Apache uses recycled produced water and nonpotable, brackish groundwater to reduce its use of fresh water. \n   Benefiting our communities  - Apache aims to benefit our communities by hiring and spending locally. In 2017, 97 percent of Apache employees were local nationals, and nearly 30 percent of the company's spending was with local vendors. Apache also contributed  $34 million  in local taxes assessed upon current company reserves. \n The 2018 report was prepared using the Global Reporting Initiative\u2019s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards and meets the requirements for a core-level report. GRI is a nonprofit organization that promotes economic, environmental and social sustainability. Its comprehensive sustainability reporting model is widely used around the world. Also consulted were the  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB), IPIECA\u2019s Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting, and Disclosing the Facts 2019. \n "},

Adjusted production, which excludes Egypt noncontrolling interest and tax barrels and 2017 divestitures, was 401,000 BOE per day, up 13 percent over third-quarter 2017; \n\t Achieved U.S. production of 272,000 BOE per day and record Permian Basin production of 222,000 BOE per day, up 31 percent and 38 percent over third-quarter 2017, respectively; \n\t Delivered strong cash flow from operations of $1 billion, with nearly 70 percent of reported oil production receiving Brent or Gulf Coast-linked pricing; \n\t Expecting strong fourth-quarter adjusted production volume growth of 20,000 BOE per day, approximately half of which will come from oil; raising full-year 2018 U.S. production guidance to 262,000 BOE per day; \n\t Altus Midstream Company transaction to close in November 2018, which is expected to fund fourth quarter 2018 and future Alpine High midstream expenditures; \n\t Anticipate 2019 production at the high-end of previously announced guidance of 410,000 to 440,000 BOE per day on an annual upstream capital program of $3 billion; and \n\t Resumed share buyback program during the third quarter; announced additional share repurchase authorization of 40 million shares. \n HOUSTON, Oct. 31, 2018 \u2013 Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and operational results for the third quarter of 2018. \n\n Apache reported earnings of $81 million or $0.21 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2018. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates, the most significant of which was a $75 million after tax loss incurred as a result of the bond tender exercise. When adjusted for this and other smaller items that impact the comparability of results, Apache\u2019s third-quarter earnings were $244 million or $0.63 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $1 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (adjusted EBITDAX) was $1.4 billion.\u00a0 \n\n \u201cApache continued our strong performance in the third quarter of 2018, delivering 31 percent growth in U.S. production year over year. The Permian Basin continues to be the key driver, with oil production up 16 percent and total production up 38 percent year over year. Our significant Brent and LLS oil price leverage and robust NGL realizations, combined with this production performance, resulted in impressive earnings and cash flow growth. Our positive production trends will continue in the fourth quarter, prompting us to again raise our full-year 2018 U.S. production guidance,\u201d said John J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president. \n\n \u201cDuring the third quarter, we also achieved a very important objective with the announcement of our Altus Midstream transaction. This will establish an entity capable of funding future midstream investment needs at Alpine High. Importantly, the deal will allow Apache to maintain control of the midstream buildout as we ramp up production at Alpine High,\u201d continued Christmann.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n Third-quarter operational summary  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n Highlights from the company\u2019s three principal areas include: \n\n United States  \u2013 U.S. production averaged 272,000 BOE per day. The company averaged 18 rigs and drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells. \n\n Permian Basin  \u2013 Third-quarter production in the Permian Basin averaged 222,000 BOE per day, with total production up 38 percent and oil up 16 percent year over year. This growth reflects the ongoing development of Wolfcamp oil zones in the Midland and Delaware basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. The company averaged 18 rigs and five frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter and drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells.\n\n\t Midland Basin  \u2013 Activity continues to focus on pad development in the Wolfcamp formation. During the quarter, the company drilled and completed 11 gross-operated wells and added one rig to optimize its rig-to-frac crew ratio. Contribution to oil growth from this addition will begin during the fourth quarter and continue into 2019. \n\t\t Delaware Basin  \u2013 Apache\u2019s activity in the Delaware Basin currently includes operations in Alpine High, Dixieland, and Pecos Bend in Reeves County and the slope play in southeast New Mexico. At Alpine High, production in the third quarter averaged 49,000 BOE per day, a 52-percent increase over the second quarter of 2018. During the quarter, the company drilled and completed 23 gross-operated wells. Well costs and lease operating costs in the play continue to come down in-line with expectations despite upward pressure on service costs. \n\t \n Egypt  \u2013 Apache averaged 12 rigs during the quarter and drilled and completed 24 gross-operated wells with an 83-percent success rate. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, averaged 78,000 BOE per day. The company has acquired approximately 1 million acres to date of a planned 2.6 million-acre seismic shoot. During the quarter, Apache initiated the next phase of the program in our new Northwest Razzak concession. \n\n North Sea  \u2013 Apache averaged three rigs during the quarter and produced 51,000 BOE per day, which was down slightly from the second quarter due to scheduled turnaround maintenance. Production is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, as the company brought its fourth development well online in the Callater field in September and plans to accelerate initial production at Garten from first-quarter 2019 to fourth-quarter 2018, only seven months after its discovery. \n\n Financial liquidity update \n\n During the quarter, the company restructured its debt portfolio with a tender offer and a new $1 billion 10-year, senior-debt offering. Proceeds from the new note offering were used to refinance existing debt and resulted in an extension of the debt maturity profile and a reduction in the average cost of debt. \n\n The company also reinitiated share repurchase activity under an existing authorization which had 7.8 million shares remaining as of June 30, 2018. 924,000 shares were repurchased under this authorization in the third quarter and repurchases continue in the fourth quarter. Apache\u2019s board of directors recently authorized an additional 40 million share-repurchase program. \n\n Capital and production outlook  \n\n Upstream oil and gas investment was $844 million in the third quarter, which included $48 million for incremental leasehold acquisition and retention. Apache also invested $122 million for Alpine High midstream activity. Effective Oct. 1, 2018, Alpine High midstream infrastructure will be funded by Altus Midstream Company following the closing of the transaction which is expected in November 2018. \n\n Apache anticipates upstream capital investment of approximately $800 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $65 million for leasehold acquisition and retention, bringing the expected 2018 upstream total budget to approximately $3.1 billion. Strong execution and well performance in the third quarter are prompting the company to raise its 2018 U.S. production guidance to 262,000 BOE per day. Adjusted international production guidance for 2018 is now 133,000 BOE per day. \n\n In 2019, Apache is planning a $3 billion annual capital program, which will enable the company to maintain its current activity levels. The company expects 2019 production levels at the high-end of previously announced 2019 guidance of 410,000 to 440,000 BOE per day. \n\n Details on additional financial and operational guidance can be found in the Third-Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Supplement at  www.apachecorp.com/financialdata . \n\n \u201cDuring the third quarter, we increased activity to optimize drilling and completions and improve efficiencies through longer laterals, larger fracs and facility expansions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our upstream capital spending to be in line with levels we have maintained for more than a year. \n\n \u201cAs we head into 2019, we are well positioned to generate sustainable liquids production growth and positive free cash flow, while maintaining flexibility to respond quickly to changing industry conditions,\u201d concluded Christmann. \n\n Conference call \n\n Apache will host a conference call to discuss its third-quarter 2018 results at 10 a.m. Central time, Thursday, Nov. 1. The conference call will be webcast from Apache's website at  www.apachecorp.com  and  investor.apachecorp.com , and the webcast replay will be archived there as well.

Alpine High  contains more than 5,000 feet of vertical hydrocarbon bearing formations across approximately 340,000 contiguous net acres,\u201d said John Christmann IV, chief executive officer and president of Apache. \n\n \u201cFor Apache, this is a very strategic transaction with a world-class partner at an attractive valuation. Since our discovery of  Alpine High , we have invested nearly  $1 billion  in an extensive network of fit-for-purpose infrastructure to meet the current and future processing and transport needs of the play. Today\u2019s announcement is a strong endorsement of the quality of investment we have made to date. \n\n \u201cThis transaction facilitates the allocation of Apache\u2019s capital to the development of the vast  Alpine High  upstream resource base. In turn, focused capital development in the upstream should bring significant growth to Altus Midstream for many years to come,\u201d concluded Christmann. \n\n Kevin McCarthy, chairman of the board of directors of KAAC, stated, \u201cWe are very excited to partner with Apache to form Altus Midstream. This transaction fits all the criteria we outlined at the time of KAAC\u2019s initial public offering and creates a pure-play, Permian-focused midstream C-corp. We believe investors will appreciate the clear alignment of interests between Altus Midstream and Apache as well as the company\u2019s investor-friendly structure. Altus Midstream does not have incentive distribution rights and is well positioned to execute on its growth plans. We look forward to working with our partners to create value for Altus Midstream\u2019s shareholders.\u201d \n\n Brian Freed, Apache\u2019s senior vice president, Midstream and Marketing, who will become the chief executive officer of the new company, said, \u201cWe are launching Altus Midstream with the support and financial strength of Apache and Kayne Anderson, two highly respected industry leaders. We have a strong growth platform at  Alpine High  with a large, contiguous acreage dedication in a proven play, infrastructure in-place to accommodate a significant ramp in volume, and options for equity participation in five planned pipelines that will provide connectivity from the  Permian Basin  to the  Texas Gulf Coast . \n\n \u201cAltus Midstream expects to have more than  $900 million  of cash and no debt at closing and is projected to be free-cash-flow positive by 2021. With this strong financial position, the company will have substantial borrowing capacity to accommodate its growth plans. We see great opportunities to expand our asset base in  Alpine High , in surrounding areas of the  Delaware Basin , and elsewhere in the  Permian Basin .\u00a0 We will have the financial capacity to expand our footprint both in terms of our physical asset base as well as the ability to access volumes from third-party operators outside of  Alpine High ,\u201d concluded Freed. \n\n Altus Midstream assets  \n\n The Altus Midstream assets include rich-gas processing plants with inlet capacity of 380 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, lean-gas treating and compression plants with inlet capacity of 400 MMcf per day, 123 miles of gathering pipelines, and 55 miles of processed gas pipelines with three market connections. By the end of 2020, Altus Midstream plans to add 1 Bcf per day of cryogenic, rich-gas processing. \n\n Additionally, Altus Midstream will hold options to purchase equity ownership in five planned pipelines, including: \n\n Gulf Coast Express:  Option for up to 15 percent interest in a natural gas pipeline to Agua Dulce; operated by Kinder Morgan, expected in-service date in  October 2019 . \n\t\u00a0 \n\t Salt Creek NGL Line:  Option for 50 percent interest in an NGL header from  Alpine High  to Waha; operated by Salt Creek Midstream, expected in-service date in the first quarter of 2019. \n\t\u00a0 \n\t EPIC Crude:  Option for up to 15 percent interest in a crude oil pipeline to Corpus Christi; operated by  EPIC Midstream Holdings , expected in-service date in the second half of 2019. \n\t\u00a0 \n\t Shin Oak:  Option for up to 33 percent interest in a long-haul NGL line to Mont Belvieu; operated by  Enterprise Products Partners , expected in-service date in the second-quarter 2019. \n\t\u00a0 \n\t Permian Highway :  Option for up to 33 percent interest in a proposed natural gas pipeline to Katy / Agua Dulce (subject to agreement on definitive documentation); to be operated by Kinder Morgan, expected in-service date in late 2020. \n Other transaction details \n\n Altus Midstream will have an estimated market capitalization of  $3.5 billion  at formation, assuming 354.4 million common shares outstanding at a  $10  share price. Apache will receive 251.9 million shares and own 71.1 percent of Altus Midstream. KAAC will contribute approximately  $952 million  in cash at formation, which is composed of proceeds from KAAC\u2019s initial public offering of  $380 million  and proceeds from the private placement of Class A shares of  $572 million . These proceeds (net of transaction expenses) will be used to fund ongoing midstream investments. Apache will have the ability to earn an additional 37.5 million shares if certain share price and operational thresholds are met over the next five years. \n\n KAAC has entered into agreements to sell approximately 57.2 million shares of its Class A common stock at a price of  $10  per share in a private placement. This private placement was anchored by accounts managed by  Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors  and other leading institutional investors, including  Advisory Research, Inc. ; certain funds managed or advised by  Capital Research and Management Company ,  Cushing Asset Management, LP ;  Magnetar Capital ,  Salient Partners  and  Tortoise Capital Advisors, LLC . Directors, management and employees of both Kayne Anderson and Apache are investing  $28 million  in the private placement. \n\n Altus Midstream will be structured as a C-corp with no incentive distribution rights. Cash-on-hand, additional follow-on funding, and future internally generated cash will be used to fund the ongoing build-out of midstream infrastructure at  Alpine High  and potential investment in long-haul pipelines. \nWith a planned effective date of  Oct. 1, 2018 , the transaction funds Apache\u2019s projected fourth-quarter 2018  Alpine High  midstream capital spend of approximately  $170 million  and provides future midstream capital funding for Apache at  Alpine High . \n\n Upon closing, Apache and Altus Midstream will enter into an agreement pursuant to which Apache will provide construction, operations and maintenance services for Altus Midstream. \n\n The transaction is subject to approval by KAAC shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions. Closing is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018, at which time KAAC will trade on the NASDAQ under the name  Altus Midstream Company  with a new ticker symbol to be determined. \n\n Transaction advisors \n\n Barclays Capital Inc.  and  Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  acted as financial advisors and  Bracewell LLP  acted as legal advisor to Apache on the transaction. Citigroup acted as financial advisor and  Latham & Watkins LLP  acted as legal advisor to KAAC. Citigroup, Barclays and Credit Suisse acted as placement agents on the private placement of Class A shares. \n\n Conference call and additional materials \n\n Apache and KAAC will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at  4 p.m. Central time ,  Wednesday, Aug. 8 . The conference call will be webcast from Apache's website at  www.apachecorp.com  and  investor.apachecorp.com  and on KAAC\u2019s website at  www.kaynespac.com .

We refer to the Series Maximums, the Pool 1 Maximum, and the Pool 2 Maximum as the \u201cTender Maximums.\u201d \n\n The Acceptance Priority Level procedures will operate concurrently, but separately, for the Pool 1 Notes and the Pool 2 Notes. Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, the Tender Maximums, and proration, all Pool 1 Notes and Pool 2 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted pursuant to the Offers. All Pool 1 Notes and Pool 2 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will, subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price and the Tender Maximums, be accepted before any Pool 1 Notes or Pool 2 Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted pursuant to the Offers. However, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will, subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price and the Tender Maximums, be accepted for purchase in priority to other Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date, even if such Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline. If the aggregate amount of Pool 1 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline equals or exceeds the Pool 1 Maximum, Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw Pool 1 Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date will not have any such Pool 1 Notes accepted for purchase regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Pool 1 Notes.\u00a0 If the aggregate amount of Pool 2 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline equals or exceeds the Pool 2 Maximum, Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw Pool 2 Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date will not have any such Pool 2 Notes accepted for purchase regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Pool 2 Notes. As such, there can be no assurance that any or all tendered Notes of a given Acceptance Priority level will be accepted for purchase. The Offers are open to all Holders of the Notes. \n\n If purchasing all the validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes of a given Acceptance Priority Level on the applicable Settlement Date would cause the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price or the Tender Maximums to be exceeded on such Settlement Date, Apache will accept such Notes on a pro rata basis, to the extent any Notes of such Acceptance Priority Level are accepted for purchase, so as to not exceed the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price or the Tender Maximums (with adjustments to avoid the purchase of Notes in a principal amount other than in the applicable minimum denomination requirements contained in the indentures governing the Notes and integral multiples of  $1,000  in excess thereof). As such, there can be no assurance that any or all tendered Notes of a given Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted for purchase, even if validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Deadline. \n\n Apache reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or eliminate the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, the Pool 1 Maximum, the Pool 2 Maximum, and/or the Series Maximums at any time without extending the applicable Withdrawal Deadline (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), subject to applicable law. \n\n Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, the Tender Maximums, proration, and the terms and conditions of the Offers, Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be eligible to receive consideration, per  $1,000  principal amount, equal to the applicable Total Consideration for such Series of Notes. The total consideration (the \u201cTotal Consideration\u201d) includes the applicable early tender premium for such Series of Notes set forth in the tables above (the \u201cEarly Tender Premium\u201d). Holders must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline in order to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration for such Notes purchased pursuant to the Offers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive consideration, per  $1,000  principal amount, equal to the applicable Total Consideration less the applicable Early Tender Premium (the \u201cTender Consideration\u201d) for such Series of Notes. In each case, such Holders will also be entitled to receive accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the last interest payment date for the applicable Series of Notes up to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date, if and when the applicable Notes are accepted for purchase (such interest with respect to such Series of Notes, the \u201cAccrued Interest\u201d). \n\n Apache reserves the right, but is under no obligation, at any time after the Early Tender Deadline and before the Expiration Date, to accept Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for purchase on a date determined at Apache\u2019s option (such date, if any, the \u201cEarly Settlement Date\u201d). Apache currently expects the Early Settlement Date, if any, to occur on  August 24, 2018 . If Apache chooses to exercise its option to have an Early Settlement Date, Apache will purchase any remaining Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Date, subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, the Tender Maximums, the application of the Acceptance Priority Levels, and all conditions to the Offers having been satisfied or waived by Apache, on the Expiration Date. The final settlement date (the \u201cFinal Settlement Date,\u201d and each of the Early Settlement Date and the Final Settlement Date, a \u201cSettlement Date\u201d), if any, is expected to be  September 10, 2018 , unless extended by Apache. If Apache chooses not to exercise Apache\u2019s option to have an Early Settlement Date, it will purchase all Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date, subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, the Tender Maximums, the application of the Acceptance Priority Levels, and all conditions to the Offers having been satisfied or waived by Apache, on the Final Settlement Date. No tenders of Notes submitted after the Expiration Date will be valid. \n\n BofA Merrill Lynch,  Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC , and  J.P.

\u201cTotal Consideration\u201d) validly tendered on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase by Apache will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread for such Series of Notes set forth in the column entitled \u201cFixed Spread\u201d in the applicable table above, over the applicable yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security set forth for such Series of Notes in the column entitled \u201cReference Security\u201d in the applicable table above, as calculated by the Dealer Managers (as defined below) at  11:00 a.m. ,  New York City  time, on  August 23 , 2018.\u00a0 The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium of  $30  per  $1,000  in aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase in the Offers (the \u201cEarly Tender Premium\u201d).\u00a0 The aggregate purchase price for the Notes accepted for purchase will include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the last interest payment date for the applicable Series of Notes up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date (as defined below). \n\n The settlement date for the Notes validly tendered on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase (the \u201cEarly Settlement Date\u201d) is expected to be  August 24, 2018 , the second business day after the Early Tender Deadline. \n\n The deadline for Holders to validly withdraw tenders of Notes has passed. Accordingly, Notes that were tendered at or before the Early Tender Deadline may not be withdrawn or revoked, except as required by applicable law. \n\n Each Offer will expire at  11:59 p.m. ,  New York City  time, on  September 6, 2018 , unless extended or earlier terminated. \u00a0However, because the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price as modified hereby, and Apache does not intend to further increase the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in the Offers. \n\n Notes not accepted for purchase will be promptly credited to the account of the registered holder of such Notes with  The Depository Trust Company  in accordance with the Offer to Purchase. \n\n Apache\u2019s obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to each Offer is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver by Apache of a number of conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase, including the receipt by Apache of the net proceeds from the issuance of not less than  $800,000,000  in principal amount of indebtedness in one or more debt financing transactions on terms reasonably satisfactory to Apache (the \u201cFinancing Condition\u201d). Apache expects the Financing Condition to be satisfied on  August 23, 2018  by the closing of its offering of  $1,000,000,000  in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% notes due 2028. Apache may amend, extend, or, subject to certain conditions and applicable law, terminate each Offer at any time in its sole discretion. \n\n BofA Merrill Lynch,  Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC , and  J.P.

applicable Total Consideration for each Series of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline was determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread for such Series of Notes set forth in the column entitled \u201cFixed Spread\u201d in the applicable table above, over the applicable yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security set forth for such Series of Notes in the column entitled \u201cReference Security\u201d in the applicable table above, as calculated by the Dealer Managers (as defined below) at  11:00 a.m. ,  New York City  time, on  August 23 , 2018.\u00a0 The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium of  $30  per  $1,000  in aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase in the Offers.\u00a0 The aggregate purchase price for the Notes accepted for purchase will include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the last interest payment date for the applicable Series of Notes up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date (as defined below). \n\n The settlement date for the Notes validly tendered on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase (the \u201cEarly Settlement Date\u201d) is expected to be  August 24, 2018 , the second business day after the Early Tender Deadline. \n\n The deadline for Holders to validly withdraw tenders of Notes has passed. Accordingly, Notes that were tendered at or before the Early Tender Deadline may not be withdrawn or revoked, except as required by applicable law. \n\n Each Offer will expire at  11:59 p.m. ,  New York City  time, on  September 6, 2018 , unless extended or earlier terminated. However, because the aggregate purchase price of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, as modified, and Apache does not intend to further increase the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Price, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in the Offers. \n\n Notes not accepted for purchase will be promptly credited to the account of the registered holder of such Notes with  The Depository Trust Company  in accordance with the Offer to Purchase. \n\n Apache\u2019s obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to each Offer is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver by Apache of a number of conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase, including the receipt by Apache of the net proceeds from the issuance of not less than  $800,000,000  in principal amount of indebtedness in one or more debt financing transactions on terms reasonably satisfactory to Apache (the \u201cFinancing Condition\u201d). The Financing Condition was satisfied on  August 23, 2018  by the closing of Apache\u2019s offering of  $1,000,000,000  in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% notes due 2028. Apache may amend, extend, or, subject to certain conditions and applicable law, terminate each Offer at any time in its sole discretion. \n\n BofA Merrill Lynch,  Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC , and  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  are acting as Dealer Managers (the \u201cDealer Managers\u201d) and  D. F. King & Co., Inc.  is acting as the Tender Agent and Information Agent for the Offers.

These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. When adjusted for these and certain additional items that impact the comparability of results, Apache\u2019s first-quarter earnings were $124 million or $0.32 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $615 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $799 million in operating cash flow. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (adjusted EBITDAX) was $1.1 billion. \n \n\tJohn J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president, said, \u201cDuring the first quarter, Apache delivered strong operational results and U.S. production significantly above guidance. Outperformance in the United States was driven by a combination of shorter completion cycle times, improving efficiencies and excellent performance from new wells.\u00a0 \n \n\t\u201cInternationally, production was in line with our guidance, and our exposure to Brent oil pricing contributed to high margins, high cash returns and strong free cash flow. The first quarter was very good from an execution and cost-control standpoint, and we are seeing continued momentum into the second quarter,\u201d said Christmann. \n \n\t First-quarter operational summary    \n \n\tHighlights from the company\u2019s three principal areas include: \n \n\t\t United States  \u2013 U.S. production averaged 232,000 BOE per day. The company averaged 17 rigs and drilled and completed 60 gross-operated wells.\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Permian Basin  \u2013 First-quarter production in the Permian Basin averaged 183,000 BOE per day, with oil up 14 percent and total production up 24 percent year over year.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Midland Basin  \u2013 Apache has transitioned primarily to multiwell pad development utilizing optimized pattern and spacing configurations. Across three pads, the company placed 12 wells on production in the Wolfcamp formation with an average peak 30-day initial production (IP) rate of 173 BOE per day per 1,000 lateral feet and consisting of 75 percent oil. Notably, Apache tested its first Wolfcamp C producer, which achieved a 30-day IP of 196 BOE per day per 1,000 lateral feet and consisting of 70 percent oil. Based on conservative early-stage assessments, this result could lead to the addition of several hundred Wolfcamp C locations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tApache has implemented a new completion design with more optimal stage and cluster spacing, which is contributing to improved early-time well performance. The company is fracture stimulating more lateral feet per day, completing wells faster and more efficiently, and realizing significant cost savings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Delaware Basin  \u2013 The company averaged 10 rigs and drilled and completed 29 gross-operated wells in the Delaware. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAt Alpine High, production averaged 26,000 BOE per day, a 33-percent increase over fourth-quarter 2017. Apache has begun the transition to pattern and spacing testing as well as development drilling on multiwell pads. Pad operations and well design changes are driving increased efficiencies and lower well costs. The company made significant progress toward its cost reduction target during the first quarter, with well costs down 20 percent over 2017 average well costs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring the quarter, Apache brought online its first multiwell test in the wet gas window of the play, the four-well Chinook pad, which contains 1,350 British thermal units wet gas and oil. The average 30-day IP rates for these wells was 1,366 BOE per day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t Egypt  \u2013 Apache averaged 14 rigs during the quarter and drilled and completed 28 gross-operated wells with an 86-percent success rate. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, averaged 80,000 BOE per day. During the quarter, Apache completed seven wells with 24-hour IP rates exceeding 1,000 BOE per day. The company has completed approximately 20 percent of its 2.6-million-acre, high-resolution, high-density 3D seismic survey in the Western Desert, which it believes will uncover impactful oil growth opportunities on its newly awarded concessions and legacy acreage. \n\t\t\u00a0 \n\t \n\t\t North Sea  \u2013 Apache averaged three rigs during the quarter and produced 54,000 BOE per day. The company announced a significant discovery at the Garten prospect in the Beryl area, which encountered more than 700 feet of net oil pay in stacked, high-quality, Jurassic-aged sandstone reservoirs. The recoverable resource is expected to exceed 10 million barrels of light oil, which is at the high end of predrill estimates. Apache has a 100-percent working interest in the Garten discovery. The company will revisit its 2019 and 2020 international production guidance as well tieback and development activities progress.\u00a0 \n \n\t Capital investment and financial position\u00a0 \n \n\tOil-and-gas capital investment was $857 million during the quarter, with $115 million for Alpine High midstream. More than two-thirds of the capital spend in the quarter was focused on the Permian Basin.\u00a0 \n \n\tIn March 2018, the company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with commitments totaling $4 billion. Apache retired $150 million of notes that matured in February and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and net debt of $7.3 billion.\u00a0 \n \n\t 2018 outlook and guidance update\u00a0 \n \n\tSolid operational execution and strong well performance in the first quarter is prompting Apache to raise its 2018 U.S. production guidance range to 250,000 BOE to 258,000 BOE per day from a previous range of 245,000 BOE to 255,000 BOE per day and expects a slight increase in its U.S. oil mix for the year. Capital guidance of $3 billion remains unchanged for the year.\u00a0 \n \n\tFurther details on other financial and operational guidance items for the second quarter and full year 2018 can be found in the First-Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Supplement. \n \n\t\u201cWe are very pleased with our results year to date, as our methodical approach to delineation and development is generating improved capital efficiency, higher returns and attractive production growth. I believe 2018 will be a year in which Apache differentiates itself operationally, particularly in the Permian Basin, where our measured pace is enabling the timely integration of key learnings and the ability to more effectively manage the inflationary service cost environment,\u201d Christmann concluded.\u00a0 \n \n\t Conference call \n \n\tApache will host a conference call to discuss its first-quarter 2018 results at 10 a.m. Central time, Thursday, May 3. The conference call will be webcast from Apache's website at www.apachecorp.com and investor.apachecorp.com, and the webcast replay will be archived there as well.

These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. When adjusted for these and certain additional items that impact the comparability of results, Apache\u2019s second-quarter earnings were $192 million or $0.50 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $1.1 billion. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $932 million in operating cash flow. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses (adjusted EBITDAX) was $1.3 billion. \n\n \u201cApache\u2019s operational and strategic delivery have been exceptional through the first half of 2018. We are proactively managing our costs, operating at an activity level that maximizes capital efficiency, and we have established considerable momentum that is now showing up in our results,\u201d said John J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president. \u201cIn the United States, the Permian Basin was our primary growth driver, with oil production in the Midland and Delaware basins up 20,000 barrels per day year-over-year and 6,000 barrels per day over the first quarter.\u201d \n\n Second-quarter operational summary\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n Highlights from the company\u2019s three principal areas include: \n\n United States  \u2013 U.S. production averaged 255,000 BOE per day. The company averaged 17 rigs and drilled and completed 70 gross-operated wells. \n Permian Basin  \u2013 Second-quarter production in the Permian Basin averaged 202,000 BOE per day, with total production up 39 percent and oil up 25 percent year-over-year. \n\t\u00a0\n\t Midland Basin  \u2013 Activity continues to focus on pad development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. During the quarter, the company brought 22 wells online in the Midland Basin. Learnings from strategic testing are enabling highly efficient and optimized full-field development. Apache has recently made significant changes to its completion designs, resulting in lower cycle times and cost reductions of nearly $400,000 for the average completion. \n\t\t\u00a0 \n\t\t Delaware Basin  \u2013 Apache\u2019s activity in the Delaware Basin includes operations in Dixieland and Alpine High in Reeves County and the slope play in southeast New Mexico. The company brought 41 Delaware Basin wells online, most of which were late in the quarter. \n\t\tAt Alpine High, production in the second quarter averaged 32,000 BOE per day, a 23-percent increase over the first quarter of 2018. Well costs in the play continue to come down despite upward pressure on service costs. Year-to-date, average costs per treated lateral foot are down by 25 percent. After analyzing successful results from its strategic testing programs, the company is increasing its investment in longer laterals and larger stimulations. \n\t\t\u00a0 \n\t \n\t Egypt  \u2013 Apache averaged 13 rigs during the quarter and drilled and completed 34 gross-operated wells. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, averaged 80,000 BOE per day. The company recently added a third new concession of 650,000 gross acres in the East Bahariya area, bringing Apache\u2019s total Egypt position to more than 6 million gross acres. This further enhances a highly prospective acreage position and provides a substantial inventory of opportunities for many years to come. \n\t\u00a0 \n\t North Sea  \u2013 Apache averaged three rigs during the quarter and produced 54,000 BOE per day, which was relatively flat over the first quarter. Two high-rate wells at Callater and Garten are expected to materially increase the North Sea production profile in late 2018 and early 2019. \n Capital investment and financial position  \n\n Oil-and-gas capital investment was $833 million during the quarter, including $116 million for Alpine High midstream. Total capital investment for the first half of the year was $1.7 billion. The company anticipates maintaining this pace of investment in the second half of the year, bringing the full-year spending outlook to approximately $3.4 billion, compared to prior guidance of $3 billion. This spend level anticipates a full year of Alpine High midstream investment, which may change with a potential transaction. \n\n The incremental capital is necessary to align and optimize drilling and completion activity in the Midland Basin and to fund investment in longer laterals, larger completions and facility expansions at Alpine High. These activity modifications incorporate learnings from the company\u2019s recent strategic tests and are expected to result in increased productivity and improved returns. \n\n At current strip prices, the capital increase will be fully funded through cash flow from operations and will provide significant incremental production in 2019 and beyond. \n\n 2018 outlook and guidance update \n\n Strong execution and well performance in the second quarter are prompting the company to raise its 2018 U.S. production guidance for the second time this year. The updated guidance of 260,000 BOE per day is above the high-end of the previous range of 250,000 to 258,000 BOE per day.\u00a0\u00a0At Alpine High, full-year 2018 guidance is now 45,000 BOE per day, or the midpoint of the previous guidance range. \n\n Adjusted international production guidance for 2018 is expected to be approximately 134,000 BOE per day, just below the midpoint of the previous range of 130,000 to 140,000 BOE per day. This includes a significant impact of higher-than-planned Brent prices on Egypt net production volumes. \n\n Further details on other financial and operational guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018 can be found in the Second-Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Supplement at  www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. \n\n \u201cApache is executing extremely well on all fronts. We are realizing capital efficiency and productivity improvements that are increasingly evident in our financial and operational results. In the Permian Basin, our drilling and completion operations are very efficient, and our wells are outperforming. Our primary infrastructure is in place at Alpine High, and we are in the very early stages of a significant, long-term production ramp up. Furthermore, we have progressed an Alpine High midstream transaction to advanced stages and anticipate closing before year-end. \n\n \u201cInternationally, we are generating significant free cash flow bolstered by Brent oil pricing. Our strategy and investment decisions in these regions are designed to deliver long-term oil growth in Egypt and to sustain production volumes in the North Sea. Our recent discoveries at Callater and Garten in the North Sea and our large-scale, high-density seismic and new acreage concessions in Egypt, give us confidence in our ability to deliver on this strategy while simultaneously maintaining or growing free cash flow. \n\n \u201cGiven our strong well performance trends, capital efficiency improvements, and the planned increase in 2018 investment, we anticipate upside bias to our 2019 and 2020 production guidance, which we will revisit later this year,\u201d Christmann concluded. \n\n Conference call \n\n Apache will host a conference call to discuss its second-quarter 2018 results at 10 a.m. Central time, Thursday, Aug. 2. The conference call will be webcast from Apache's website at  www.apachecorp.com  and  investor.apachecorp.com , and the webcast replay will be archived there as well.

The discovery well, which is located 6 kilometers south of the Beryl Alpha Platform, was placed on production in late November, less than eight months after being drilled in  March 2018 . \n The discovery well at Garten encountered a downthrown structural closure with 778 feet of net oil pay in stacked, high-quality, Jurassic-aged sandstone reservoirs.\u00a0The well is currently producing from the Beryl sand at a rate of 13.7 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD) and 15.7 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMCFPD). Two lower zones were also successfully tested, and all three zones will ultimately be commingled to maximize recovery. The strong initial rate establishes excellent momentum late in the year and will positively impact Apache\u2019s 2019 production guidance.

Apache Corporation is providing a challenge grant and will match gifts up to $1 million. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n The iconic spring-fed pool at Balmorhea State Park in West Texas has been closed since early May after part of the structure collapsed during the pool\u2019s annual cleaning. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) announced in a press release last week that repairs to the historic pool are set to begin. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n The labor-intensive job will repair the damage to the concrete apron used to stabilize the diving board along the east headwall. TPWD reports that months of thorough evaluation, including extensive geotechnical examination, found that the structural failure was due to years of undermining erosion behind the wall caused by the flow of water from the springs. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u201cApache is proud to partner with Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation to support one of Texas\u2019s most treasured destinations. This public-private partnership will ensure this unique natural treasure remains an iconic part of our community for many years to come,\u201d said Apache Chief Executive Officer and President John J. Christmann IV. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Raising private funds for this project will allow available state funding to be used for other critical repair needs across the state park system. State park facilities throughout the state have been hit hard by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and devastating floods in recent years. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u201cWe are incredibly thankful to Apache for their spirit of generosity in stepping forward with this major challenge grant to help repair Balmorhea State Park and its much beloved spring-fed swimming hole,\u201d said Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Executive Director Carter Smith. \u201cThis west Texas oasis is one of Texas\u2019 great treasures, and its closure this summer was a source of deep disappointment to the Department and thousands of families who otherwise would have enjoyed basking in its magical, refreshing waters.\u00a0  With this challenge grant and the generosity of other Texans, we can  now embark upon the essential repairs to the pool without having to divert resources away from other critical repair and maintenance projects across the State Park system.\u201d \r\n \u00a0 \r\n The Civilian Conservation Corps structure was built in the mid-1930s and is the world\u2019s largest spring-fed swimming pool. More than 15 million gallons of water flow through the pool each day, gushing from the San Solomon Springs. The 1.3-acre pool is up to 25 feet deep, holds 3.5 million gallons of water and the water temperature stays at 72 to 76 degrees year-round. \r\n \u00a0 \r\n \u201cGenerations of Texans have enjoyed the cool, clear waters at Balmorhea, and we\u2019re deeply grateful for Apache\u2019s challenge grant to help us meet the fundraising goal of $2 million,\u201d said Anne Brown, Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation Executive Director. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from many individuals and companies that are interested in helping, and we hope everyone who has ever dipped a toe in this Texas treasure will consider making a donation to help.\u201d \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Online donations  may be made, or a donation may be mailed to: \r\n Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation \r\n 2914 Swiss Ave. \r\n Dallas, Texas 75204 \r\n \u00a0 \r\n All TPWF news releases available online:  www.tpwf.org/news/press-releases/ \r\n \u00a0 \r\n Since 1991,  Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation  has leveraged public funds with private philanthropy to advance Texas\u2019 proud outdoor traditions and conserve our state\u2019s wildlife, habitat, recreational areas, and natural resources.
