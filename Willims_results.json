It delivers natural gas to customers through its approximately \n      10,000-mile pipeline network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles \n      between South Texas and New York City. The system is a major provider of \n      cost-effective natural gas services that reach U.S. markets in 12 \n      Southeast and Atlantic Seaboard states, including major metropolitan \n      areas in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n     \n     \n      The Leidy South project is being designed to further expand the Transco \n      pipeline\u2019s Marcellus and Utica takeaway capacity from the Leidy Hub and \n      Zick interconnect to points downstream in Transco\u2019s Zone 6 market area.\n     \n     \n      \u201cSince 2013 the Transco pipeline\u2019s design capacity has grown by 62 \n      percent, while its Marcellus takeaway capacity has increased by \n      approximately 3 billion cubic feet per day,\u201d said Frank Ferazzi, Senior \n      Vice President of Williams\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf Operating Area. \u201cThe Leidy \n      South project allows Williams to continue to grow our strategic \n      footprint in the gas-rich Marcellus region, creating a unique \n      opportunity to expand Transco by leveraging recent expansions on \n      Williams\u2019 Northeast Gathering & Processing assets in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Williams Northeast Gathering & Processing Operating Area\u00a0Senior Vice \n      President Jim Scheel said the project is a good example of synergies \n      that can be achieved through Williams\u2019 strong position in the Marcellus \n      Basin.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis and future takeaway capacity helps Williams \u2013 and our customers \u2013 \n      capitalize on our extensive gathering system, optimizing connectivity \n      with producers strategically positioned throughout the basin, and \n      demonstrating mutual growth,\u201d said Scheel. \u201cProjects like Leidy South \n      are a natural by-product of that growth, providing producers with a \n      single, integrated Williams solution to connect abundant, cost-effective \n      Appalachian natural gas supplies with premier consuming markets located \n      all along the East Coast.\u201d\n     \n     \n      The Leidy South project will consist of compression and looping of \n      existing Transco facilities in Pennsylvania. The project will also \n      include two lease agreements; one with National Fuel Gas Supply \n      Corporation from Leidy Hub to Clermont, Pennsylvania; and a second with \n      Meade Pipeline Company from Zick to River Road on the Central Penn Line.\n     \n     \n      The preliminary schedule for project permitting activity begins with \n      Transco\u2019s planned submission in October of its request to commence the \n      pre-filing process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The Company plans to place \n      the project into full service on Oct. 6, 2018.\n     \n     \n      Backed by long-term shipper commitments, the historic project increases \n      the design capacity of the Transco pipeline, the largest-volume natural \n      gas pipeline system in the United States, by 1.7 billion cubic feet per \n      day (approximately 12 percent) to 15.8 billion cubic feet per day. In \n      the process, the project further strengthens and extends the \n      bi-directional flow of the Transco system, directly connecting Marcellus \n      gas supplies with markets as far south as Alabama.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis project makes the largest-volume pipeline system in the country \n      even larger, further executing on our strategy to connect premier \n      natural gas supply areas with the best markets in the country,\u201d said \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams president and chief executive officer. \u201cThe \n      project is significant for Pennsylvania and natural gas-consuming \n      markets all along the East Coast, alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks \n      and providing millions of consumers direct access to one of the most \n      abundant, cost-effective natural gas supply sources in the country.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Williams Chief Operating Officer Micheal Dunn added, \u201cI\u2019m proud of our \n      project team for their focus and carefully executing this complex \n      project in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Their efforts \n      have truly distinguished this project, positively collaborating with \n      regulators, key stakeholders and communities to overcome challenges and \n      install this critical infrastructure thoughtfully without experiencing \n      any significant injuries or environmental issues. Even in the final \n      months of construction, as some segments of the project area sustained \n      more than 20 inches of rainfall, our teams acted quickly to restore the \n      right-of-way and ensure environmental compliance requirements were met.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Greenfield construction on the Pennsylvania portion of the project began \n      in September 2017. The project featured the installation of 186 miles of \n      greenfield pipe, 12 miles of pipe looping, 2.5 miles of pipe \n      replacement, two new compressor stations and compressor station \n      modifications in five states.\n     \n     \n      Gene Barr, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and \n      Industry, said, \u201cProjects like Atlantic Sunrise are allowing \n      Pennsylvania to maximize the tremendous economic and energy benefits of \n      the Marcellus Shale, spurring renewed investment into the manufacturing \n      sector and creating opportunity for Pennsylvanians across the state. \n      This multi-billion dollar private infrastructure investment is \n      supporting current and future natural gas production and investment in \n      Pennsylvania, which will ultimately boost employment and tax revenues \n      for the state. Atlantic Sunrise has been a tremendous economic boom that \n      will no doubt yield benefits, both economic and environmental, for the \n      commonwealth for decades to come.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Throughout the permitting and construction process, Williams worked \n      closely with permitting agencies to minimize environmental and \n      stakeholder impacts, making modifications to more than half of the \n      original pipeline route. In addition, Williams worked with local \n      stakeholders to provide an additional $2.5 million for environmental \n      conservation projects located within the project area.\n     \n     \n      The greenfield segment of the Atlantic Sunrise project, known as the \n      Central Penn Line, is jointly owned by Transco and Meade Pipeline Co LLC \n      (Meade). Meade is owned by WGL Midstream, Cabot Oil and Gas and EIF Vega \n      Midstream.\n     \n     \n      Transco delivers natural gas to customers through its more than \n      10,000-mile pipeline network with a mainline extending 1,800 miles from \n      South Texas to New York City.

Looking forward, the Atlantic Sunrise \n      project and the Gulf Connector project will drive even higher growth in \n      fourth-quarter 2018 and 2019 on Transco. Importantly, Atlantic Sunrise \n      has opened up new markets for Marcellus producers, and that is now \n      driving accelerated growth in our Northeast G&P business segment. This \n      growth will continue for many years, and immediately upon the heels of \n      Atlantic Sunrise, we have announced another fully-contracted expansion \n      out of the Northeast Pennsylvania area to serve growing markets with \n      Transco's Leidy South Expansion.

net income attributable \n      to Williams of $129 million, an increase of $96 million from \n      third-quarter 2017. The favorable change was driven primarily by a $227 \n      million improvement in operating income due primarily to an increase in \n      service revenues in the Atlantic-Gulf segment associated with Transco \n      expansion projects placed in service in 2017 and 2018, in the Northeast \n      G&P segment from higher gathering volumes, and in the West segment due \n      to higher NGL margins reflecting higher NGL prices. The absence of \n      third-quarter 2017 impairments of certain assets was largely offset by \n      the absence of a gain on the sale of the Company's former Geismar \n      olefins plant that occurred in third-quarter 2017. Income attributable \n      to Williams also benefited from a reduction in income attributable to \n      noncontrolling interests following the WPZ Merger. A $166 million \n      increase in the income tax provision was primarily due to a net increase \n      in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that may not be realized \n      following the WPZ Merger and higher pre-tax income, partially offset by \n      a decrease in the federal statutory rate with the enactment of Tax \n      Reform.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported unaudited net income attributable to \n      Williams of $416 million, a decrease of $71 million versus the same \n      period in 2017. The unfavorable change was driven primarily by a $204 \n      million decrease in Other Investing Income due largely to the absence of \n      a $269 million gain in first-quarter 2017 associated with the \n      transaction involving certain joint-venture interests in the Permian \n      Basin and Marcellus Shale, as well as a $68 million decrease in equity \n      earnings primarily driven by lower earnings at the deepwater Discovery \n      Producer Services and the absence of operating income from the former \n      Geismar olefins plant. The unfavorable change also reflects the \n      previously described increase in the income tax provision along with the \n      absence of the benefit of releasing a $127 million valuation allowance \n      on a capital loss carryover in 2017. Partially offsetting the decrease \n      was an improvement in operating income from our current business \n      segments due largely to an increase in service revenues in the \n      Atlantic-Gulf segment from bringing Transco expansion projects online in \n      2017 and 2018, and in the Northeast G&P segment from higher gathering \n      volumes. Results also benefited from higher NGL margins in the West \n      segment and the absence of impairments of certain assets during the same \n      reporting period in 2017, largely offset by the absence of the 2017 gain \n      on sale of the Company's former Geismar olefins plant. Income \n      attributable to Williams also benefited from a reduction in income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests following the WPZ Merger.\n     \n     \n       Cash Flow From Operations \n     \n     \n      Cash flow from operations (CFFO) for third-quarter 2018 was $746 \n      million, an increase of $41 million over third-quarter 2017. \n      Year-to-date, Williams\u2019 CFFO totaled $2.331 billion compared with $2.231 \n      billion for the prior year.\u00a0The improvements compared to the prior year \n      periods were driven by increased operating income, due primarily to an \n      increase in service revenues associated with Transco expansion projects \n      placed in service in 2017 and 2018. Partially offsetting the improvement \n      were unfavorable changes in net working capital.\u00a0The year-to-date \n      improvement was also partially offset by a decline in distributions from \n      unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from deepwater Discovery Producer \n      Services.\n     \n     \n       Adjusted Results \n     \n     \n      Williams reported third-quarter 2018 Adjusted income of $243 million, a \n      $119 million increase over third-quarter 2017. Third-quarter 2018 \n      Adjusted income per share was $0.24, a 60 percent increase over \n      third-quarter 2017 Adjusted income per share of $0.15. Year-to-date, \n      Adjusted income per share was $0.61, a 45 percent improvement over the \n      same nine-month period in 2017. The improvement for both periods was \n      driven by the same factors affecting net income attributable to Williams \n      adjusted primarily for excluding the impairment of certain assets in \n      2017, the gain on the sale of the former Geismar olefins plant in 2017, \n      and the income tax provision impacts associated with valuation \n      allowances. Year-to-date Adjusted income also excludes the gain on the \n      transaction involving certain joint-venture interests.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported third-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.196 billion, \n      an $83 million increase from third-quarter 2017. The year-over-year \n      comparison was unfavorably impacted by $25 million from the adoption of \n      new revenue recognition standards in 2018. The 7.5 percent improvement \n      for third-quarter 2018 over third-quarter 2017 was driven primarily by a \n      $68 million increase in service revenues due largely to Transco \n      expansion projects brought online in 2017 and 2018 in the Atlantic-Gulf \n      segment and higher gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P segment. \n      Additionally, our current business segments benefited from a $37 million \n      improvement in commodity margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.441 billion, an \n      increase of $70 million from the same nine-month reporting period in \n      2017. The year-over-year comparison was unfavorably impacted by $65 \n      million from the adoption of new revenue recognition standards in 2018. \n      The favorable change was driven by a $233 million increase in service \n      revenues due largely to Transco expansion projects brought online in \n      2017 and 2018 in the Atlantic-Gulf segment and higher gathering volumes \n      in the Northeast G&P segment. Also contributing to the improvement were \n      $87 million increased commodity margins, which were partially offset by \n      the absence of EBITDA earned by the former Geismar olefins plant, and \n      also by a $58 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint \n      ventures due primarily to less production on the deepwater Discovery \n      system. Year-to-date, Williams' current business segments increased \n      Adjusted EBITDA by $153 million versus the same reporting period in 2017.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow \n     \n     \n      For third-quarter 2018, Williams generated $768 million in distributable \n      cash flow (DCF) compared with $603 million in DCF for third-quarter \n      2017. DCF was favorably impacted by the Company's improvement in \n      Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning with first-quarter 2018 results, Williams has \n      discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF associated with 2016 \n      contract restructuring prepayments in the Barnett Shale and \n      Mid-Continent region. For third-quarter 2018, the coverage ratio is 1.86.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams generated $2.135 billion in DCF, a $184 million \n      increase over the same period in 2017. DCF was favorably impacted by the \n      Company's improvement in Adjusted EBITDA and eliminating the adjustment \n      in 2018 involving the removal of DCF associated with 2016 contract \n      restructuring prepayments in the Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. \n      Partially offsetting these improvements were higher maintenance capital \n      expenditures compared with the same reporting period in 2017. \n      Year-to-date, the coverage ratio is 1.65.\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams' operations following the Aug. 10, 2018,

Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      This segment includes Williams' interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is developing a \n      pipeline project, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $492 million for \n      third-quarter 2018, compared with $430 million for third-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $49 million to $480 million for the same \n      time period. The improvement in both measures reflects $43 million \n      increased service revenues driven primarily by Transco's \"Big 5\" \n      expansion projects placed into service in 2017 and additional expansion \n      projects placed into service in 2018. Partially offsetting these \n      improvements was a $15 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from \n      joint ventures due largely to a decline in volumes on the deepwater \n      Discovery system's Hadrian field.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $1.418 billion, an increase of $84 million over the same nine-month \n      period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased $56 million to $1.402 billion. \n      The improvement in both measures reflects $159 million increased service \n      revenues driven primarily by Transco's \"Big 5\" expansion projects placed \n      into service in 2017 and additional expansion projects placed into \n      service in 2018. Partially offsetting the improvement was an $80 million \n      decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a \n      significant decline in volumes on the deepwater Discovery system's \n      Hadrian field and an increase in operating and administrative costs.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes Williams' interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett Shale region \n      of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the \n      Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent \n      region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware and Permian basins. \n      This reporting segment also includes an NGL and natural gas marketing \n      business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 percent interest in an \n      NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a 50 percent equity-method \n      investment in OPPL, a 50 percent interest in Jackalope Gas Gathering \n      Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope) (an equity-method investment following \n      deconsolidation as of June 30, 2018) and a 43 percent interest in Rocky \n      Mountain Midstream. Through third-quarter 2018, this segment included \n      natural gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in New Mexico \n      and in Ignacio, Colorado, that were part of the Company's Four Corners \n      Area business, which was sold on Oct. 1, 2018.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $412 million for \n      third-quarter 2018, compared with ($615) million for third-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million to $424 million. The improvement \n      in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the absence of a $1.021 \n      billion impairment of certain operations from third-quarter 2017, which \n      does not impact Adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA \n      reflects a $26 million increase in commodity margins due to favorable \n      prices more than offset by $6 million of regulatory charges associated \n      with Northwest Pipeline's approved rates related to Tax Reform and $29 \n      million lower service revenues, which includes an unfavorable change in \n      recognition of deferred revenue driven by the adoption of new accounting \n      standards in 2018. Service revenues would have been $25 million higher \n      if revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been applied to \n      2017 results. Adjusted EBITDA for both periods includes estimated \n      Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs). While estimated MVCs were not \n      recognized in Modified EBITDA until the fourth quarter in 2017, with the \n      adoption of new accounting standards, estimated MVC revenue is \n      recognized earlier in 2018 Modified EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $1.214 \n      billion, an increase of $1.088 billion over the same nine-month period \n      in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $32 million to $1.219 billion. The \n      improvement in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the absence of a \n      $1.021 billion impairment of certain operations in 2017, which does not \n      impact Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects a $77 \n      million increase in commodity margins due to favorable prices and $14 \n      million lower operating and administrative costs. These improvements \n      were partially offset by $18 million of regulatory charges associated \n      with Northwest Pipeline's approved rates related to Tax Reform and $38 \n      million of decreased service revenues, which includes an unfavorable \n      change in recognition of deferred revenue driven by the adoption of new \n      accounting standards in 2018. Service revenues would have been $65 \n      million higher if revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been \n      applied to 2017 results. Adjusted EBITDA for both periods includes \n      estimated MVCs, as previously discussed.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes natural gas gathering and processing, compression \n      and NGL fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily \n      in Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia and Utica Shale region of \n      eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent interest in Cardinal (a \n      consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method investment in UEOM, a \n      69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 58 percent \n      equity-method investment in Caiman II, and Appalachia Midstream \n      Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 percent \n      equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in the \n      Marcellus Shale. Williams' natural gas gathering position is the largest \n      in the entire Northeast region.\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $281 million for \n      third-quarter 2018, compared with $115 million for third-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14 percent or $35 million to $281 million. \n      The improvement in Modified EBITDA reflects the absence of a $121 \n      million impairment of certain operations from third-quarter 2017, which \n      does not impact Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures benefited from $33 \n      million increased service revenues due to higher volumes at the \n      Susquehanna and Ohio River systems and an increase in proportional \n      EBITDA of joint ventures due primarily to prices and volumes in the \n      Bradford gas gathering system and higher volumes in Marcellus South.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $786 \n      million, an increase of $198 million over the same nine-month period in \n      2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $65 million to $786 million. The \n      improvement in Modified EBITDA reflects the absence of a $121 million \n      impairment of certain operations from the same period in 2017, which \n      does not impact Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures benefited from $59 \n      million increased service revenues due to higher volumes at the \n      Susquehanna and Ohio River systems and an increase in proportional \n      EBITDA of joint ventures due primarily to increased ownership in the \n      Bradford gas gathering system and increased volumes in Marcellus South.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Following Williams' completed acquisition of Williams Partners, this \n      segment now also includes the historical results of our former petchem \n      services business.\n     \n     \n      The Other segment reported third-quarter 2018 Modified EBITDA of $6 \n      million, a decrease of $1 billion from third-quarter 2017. Adjusted \n      EBITDA increased by $1 million to $11 million. The unfavorable change in \n      Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the absence of a third-quarter \n      2017 $1.095 billion gain on the sale of the Company's former Geismar \n      olefins plant, as well as the net unfavorable impact of costs and \n      adjustments related to the WPZ Merger, partially offset by the absence \n      of a $68 million impairment of certain NGL pipeline assets in 2017. \n      These items do not impact Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams' Other segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($49) \n      million, a decrease of $1.149 billion over the same nine-month reporting \n      period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $83 million to $34 million. \n      The unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the \n      absence of a third-quarter 2017 $1.095 billion gain on the sale of the \n      Company's former Geismar olefins plant, the absence of results from the \n      former Geismar olefins plant as well as the net unfavorable impact of \n      costs and adjustments related to the WPZ Merger, partially offset by \n      lower net impairments. The unfavorable change in Adjusted EBITDA \n      reflects the absence of results from the former Geismar olefins plant.\n     \n     \n       Williams Places Atlantic Sunrise Project into Full Service \n     \n     \n      After over three years of permitting and a year of construction, the \n      Atlantic Sunrise pipeline project was mechanically completed in \n      September, and received permission from the Federal Energy Regulatory \n      Commission (FERC) to place the whole project in service on Oct. 6, 2018. \n      This nearly $3 billion expansion of the existing Transco natural gas \n      pipeline connects abundant Marcellus gas supplies to growing markets as \n      far south as Alabama.\n     \n     \n       Williams Completes Sale of Four Corners Area Business to Harvest \n      Midstream Company for $1.125 Billion \n     \n     \n      On Oct. 1, 2018, Williams announced that it had completed the sale of \n      assets and equity comprising its previous Four Corners Area business in \n      New Mexico and Colorado to Harvest Midstream Company for $1.125 billion \n      in cash. The cash proceeds will contribute to funding Williams\u2019 \n      extensive portfolio of attractive growth capital and investment \n      expenditures, including the company\u2019s recent joint-venture acquisition \n      with KKR of Discovery DJ Services from TPG Growth that was completed \n      Aug. 3, 2018. Under terms of the joint venture, Williams held a 40 \n      percent ownership stake after an initial economic contribution of \n      approximately $469 million to the total purchase price. Williams is also \n      the operator of these assets in the Denver-Julesburg (\u201cDJ\u201d) Basin and \n      holds a majority of governance voting rights in the joint venture. \n      Williams and KKR have renamed the DJ Basin business \u201cRocky Mountain \n      Midstream LLC.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Transco Files Rate Case \n     \n     \n      On Aug. 31, 2018, Transco filed a general rate case with the FERC for an \n      overall increase in rates. In September 2018, with the exception of \n      certain rates that reflected a rate decrease, the FERC accepted and \n      suspended our general rate filing to be effective March 1, 2019, subject \n      to refund and the outcome of a hearing.\n     \n     \n       Williams' Third-Quarter 2018 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A \n      Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams' third-quarter 2018 financial results package will be posted \n      shortly at  \n www.williams.com \n . \n      The materials will include the analyst package.

Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), \n      adjusted earnings per share, distributable cash flow and dividend \n      coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under \n      the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results \n      from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Distributable cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, and \n      certain other adjustments that management believes affects the \n      comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital \n      expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our \n      proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments. We \n      also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      Williams\u2019 distributable cash flow relative to its actual cash dividends \n      paid.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of assets and the cash \n      that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, nor distributable cash flow \n      are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they \n      presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. \n      They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a \n      measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States \n      generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

reported unaudited second-quarter 2018 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $135 million, an increase of $54 million from \n      second-quarter 2017. The favorable change was driven primarily by a $32 \n      million increase in operating income due primarily to an increase in \n      service revenues and NGL margins partially offset by the absence of $25 \n      million of operating income earned in second-quarter 2017 by our former \n      olefins operations. Other Investing Income for the quarter was favorably \n      impacted by a $62 million gain on the deconsolidation of Williams \n      Partners' interests in the Jackalope Gas Gathering System. Partially \n      offsetting the improvements were $66 million of impairments of certain \n      assets in second-quarter 2018 and a $33 million decrease in equity \n      earnings primarily driven by lower earnings at Discovery Producer \n      Services.\n     \n     \n      Year to date, Williams reported unaudited net income attributable to \n      Williams of $287 million, an unfavorable change of $167 million over the \n      same period in 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by a $202 million \n      unfavorable change in Other Investing Income due largely to the absence \n      of a $269 million gain in first-quarter 2017 associated with a \n      transaction involving certain joint-venture interests in the Permian \n      Basin and Marcellus Shale, partially offset by a $62 million gain on \n      Williams Partners' interests in the Jackalope Gas Gathering System. The \n      unfavorable change also reflects a $58 million decrease in equity \n      earnings primarily driven by lower earnings at Discovery Producer \n      Services and $66 million of impairments of certain assets in \n      second-quarter 2018. Partially offsetting the decrease was a $93 million \n      improvement in operating income, due primarily to an increase in service \n      revenues and NGL margins overcoming the absence of $57 million of \n      operating income earned in the first half of 2017 by our former olefins \n      operations.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported second-quarter 2018 Adjusted income per share of \n      $0.17, a 31 percent increase over second-quarter 2017 Adjusted income \n      per share of $0.13. The improvement was driven by the same factors \n      affecting net income attributable to Williams, adjusted primarily for \n      excluding the gain on the deconsolidation of the Jackalope Gas Gathering \n      System and impairments of certain assets. Year-to-date, Adjusted income \n      per share was $0.36, a 33 percent improvement over the first-half 2017 \n      result of $0.27.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported second-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.11 billion, \n      a $3 million decrease from second-quarter 2017. The modest change was \n      driven by a $37 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint \n      ventures due primarily to less production on the Discovery system, the \n      absence of $23 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in second-quarter 2017 \n      from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the \n      sale of the Geismar olefins facility, and $26 million increased \n      operating & maintenance (O&M) expenses at Williams Partners' businesses \n      primarily due to increased reliability and integrity costs at Transco. \n      Partially offsetting these decreases was a $46 million increase in \n      service revenues, driven primarily by expansion projects brought online \n      by Transco in 2017 and 2018. Second-quarter 2018 service revenues would \n      have increased by $67 million over second-quarter 2017 if \n      revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been applied to \n      second-quarter 2017 results. Additionally, NGL and Marketing margins \n      improved by $35 million.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.245 billion, a \n      decrease of $13 million from the same six-month reporting period in \n      2017. The unfavorable change was driven by the absence of $72 million \n      Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2017 from the NGL & Petchem Services business \n      primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility, a $60 \n      million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due \n      primarily to less production on the Discovery system, $38 million \n      increased O&M expenses at Williams Partners' businesses primarily due to \n      increased reliability and integrity costs at Transco, and a $12 million \n      regulatory charge per approved pipeline transportation rates associated \n      with the Tax Reform Act. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $125 \n      million increase in service revenues, driven primarily by expansion \n      projects brought online by Transco in 2017 and 2018. Service revenue \n      would have increased by $165 million over first half of 2017 if \n      revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been applied to \n      first-half 2017 results. Additionally, NGL and Marketing margins \n      improved by $49 million.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \"Our consistent strategy of connecting growing natural gas demand to \n      growing low-cost gas production delivered results which slightly \n      exceeded our business plan for second quarter, and we look forward to an \n      even stronger second half of the year as the Atlantic Sunrise project \n      nears completion and producer activity on our systems in the Northeast \n      and Wyoming is ramping up. We are also excited about the transactions \n      announced earlier this week. Selling assets in a maturing basin at \n      attractive multiples, and redeploying that capital to higher growth \n      basins enhances our position to capitalize on future growth \n      opportunities and follows our strategy to connect the best supplies to \n      the best markets.\n     \n     \n      \"It is clear that our focus on natural gas volume growth combined with \n      our advantaged infrastructure and the continued confidence in low-price \n      natural gas continues to drive demand for services on our systems. \n      Placing the Transco expansion projects into service in 2017 and 2018 is \n      now delivering exceptional fee-based revenue growth - a $50 million \n      increase for second-quarter 2018 over second-quarter 2017 for Transco \n      transportation revenues thanks to those expansion projects coming \n      online. Our growth was not limited to Transco as Williams Partners' \n      current business segments posted year-over-year increases in Adjusted \n      EBITDA for the quarter and year-to-date.\n     \n     \n      \"I'm pleased our teams were able to complete so much maintenance work \n      this quarter, especially in our high-growth areas where we accelerated \n      inspections and other key maintenance needs into this quarter to take \n      advantage of the timing of outages associated with expansion \n      construction work and project work - particularly important in \n      association with a project like Atlantic Sunrise, which is preparing to \n      bring additional loads on to that system. I'm proud of our team's \n      exceptional focus on safety and environmental compliance throughout the \n      construction and commissioning process on this large and complex project.\n     \n     \n      \"We are also making great progress on several other projects. In \n      Wyoming, we just announced an expansion on our Jackalope Gas Gathering \n      System and associated Bucking Horse gas processing facility in the \n      Powder River Basin, Niobrara Shale play that will increase processing \n      capacity to 345 million cubic feet per day ('MMcf/d') by the end of 2019 \n      to meet growing customer demand in this underserved growth basin. We \n      also completed major modifications to our Mobile Bay processing plant to \n      enable the handling of large volumes of gas liquids from Shell's \n      Norphlet fields in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, a major \n      expansion of our Oak Grove gas-processing facility in West Virginia is \n      also underway. Construction is going well on Transco's Gulf Connector \n      project, and we realized great progress on the permitting of several \n      other Transco projects in the Northeast and Northwest Pipeline in \n      Seattle.\"\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners and Other.\n

midstream businesses. The gas \n      pipeline business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline \n      joint project investments. The midstream business provides natural gas \n      gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL \n      production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; \n      deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and \n      is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries \n      and joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second-quarter 2018 Modified EBITDA of $1.115 \n      billion, an increase of $39 million from second-quarter 2017. Adjusted \n      EBITDA decreased by $7 million to $1.097 billion. The change in Adjusted \n      EBITDA was driven by a $37 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from \n      joint ventures due primarily to less production on the Discovery system, \n      the absence of $23 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in second-quarter 2017 \n      from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the \n      sale of the Geismar olefins facility, and $26 million increased O&M \n      expenses at Williams Partners' businesses primarily due to increased \n      reliability and integrity costs at Transco. Partially offsetting these \n      decreases was a $46 million increase in service revenues, driven \n      primarily by expansion projects brought online by Transco in 2017 and \n      2018. Second-quarter 2018 service revenues would have increased by $67 \n      million over second-quarter 2017 if revenue-recognition standards \n      adopted in 2018 had been applied to second-quarter 2017 results. \n      Additionally, NGL and Marketing margins improved by $35 million.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Williams Partners segment reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $2.222 billion, an improvement of $14 million over the same six-month \n      reporting period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million to \n      $2.219 billion. The slight change was driven by the absence of $72 \n      million Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2017 from the NGL & Petchem Services \n      business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins \n      facility, a $60 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint \n      ventures due primarily to less production on the Discovery system, $38 \n      million increased O&M expenses at Williams Partners' businesses \n      primarily due to increased reliability and integrity costs at Transco, \n      and a $12 million regulatory charge per approved pipeline transportation \n      rates associated with the Tax Reform Act. Partially offsetting these \n      decreases was a $125 million increase in service revenues, driven \n      primarily by expansion projects brought online by Transco in 2017 and \n      2018. Service revenue would have increased by $165 million over first \n      half of 2017 if revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been \n      applied to first-half 2017 results. Additionally, NGL and Marketing \n      margins improved by $49 million.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for second-quarter 2018 \n      are provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams \n      Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams' Other segment reported second-quarter 2018 Modified EBITDA of \n      ($57) million, a decrease of $40 million from second-quarter 2017. The \n      unfavorable change primarily reflects the impact of $66 million of \n      impairments of certain assets in second-quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA \n      increased by $4 million to $13 million.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams' Other segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($44) \n      million, a decrease of $45 million over the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2017. The unfavorable change primarily reflects the impact of \n      $66 million of impairments of certain assets in second-quarter 2018. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $11 million to $26 million.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      After consideration of the effects of the recently-announced purchase of \n      Discovery DJ Services and the divestiture of the Four Corners Area as \n      well as various other forecast updates, current guidance from Analyst \n      Day on May 17, 2018, remains unchanged except for Growth Capital \n      Expenditures, which have been revised for 2018 and 2019 for the \n      inclusion of the purchase of Discovery DJ Services and other projects \n      including 2019 planned expansions in the West (Niobrara) and Northeast \n      G&P segments.

We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, cash available for dividends \n      and other uses or distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash \n      flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net \n      income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in \n      isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in \n      accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

Their \n      high-quality gathering pipelines and processing assets, combined with \n      their industry-leading capabilities in Reeves, Ward, and Pecos counties \n      are an excellent match for the gathering systems and additional \n      capabilities that Williams is contributing as part of this transaction. \n      With the residue gas position that we will establish together with \n      Brazos, we unlock additional opportunities for value, as growing Permian \n      natural gas supply increasingly needs access to high-value demand \n      markets, including premium Gulf Coast markets served by our Transco \n      system, the nation\u2019s largest pipeline system by volume.\u201d\n     \n     \n      \u201cBrazos operates a strategically-located midstream platform in a region \n      that has seen tremendous production growth,\u201d said Brazos Chief Executive \n      Officer, Brad Iles. \u201cThis year we have continued to expand our asset \n      base in cooperation with our new sponsor, Morgan Stanley Infrastructure \n      Partners, in order to provide exceptional service to our producer \n      customers.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Iles continued, \u201cWe are excited to form this joint venture with Williams \n      and greatly appreciate the confidence they have in Brazos to entrust us \n      with operatorship of their assets and stewardship of their customers. \n      Williams is well-known as one of the nation\u2019s premier natural gas \n      midstream companies, and we believe this partnership will greatly \n      enhance both companies\u2019 efforts to develop top-tier assets in the \n      Permian Basin.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Williams President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Armstrong added, \n      \u201cThis transaction is another example of high-grading our portfolio by \n      leveraging an existing asset into a larger integrated system with better \n      growth, in a manner that improves our credit metrics over time.\u201d\n     \n     \n      RBC Capital Markets acted as the lead financial adviser to Williams for \n      this transaction.\n     \n     \n      Today\u2019s announcement does not affect Williams\u2019 current financial \n      guidance.\n     \n     \n      "},

(NYSE: WPZ) from the Four Corners \n      Area in New Mexico and Colorado.\n     \n     \n      Williams and KKR & Co. (NYSE: KKR) (\u201cKKR\u201d) today announced that they \n      have entered into an agreement to purchase Discovery DJ Services \n      (\u201cDiscovery\u201d) from TPG Growth, the middle market and growth equity \n      platform of alternative asset firm TPG, for $1.173 billion, subject to \n      customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. Discovery \n      is a Dallas-based provider of natural gas and oil gathering and natural \n      gas processing services in the southern portion of Colorado\u2019s DJ Basin.\n     \n     \n      When the acquisition closes, which is expected to occur in early August, \n      Williams and KKR will own the entirety of the Discovery midstream \n      business through a joint venture. Williams\u2019 initial economic \n      contribution and ownership will be 40 percent of the purchase price \n      while KKR\u2019s initial economic contribution and ownership will be 60 \n      percent. Under the terms of the agreed-to joint venture, Williams will \n      be the operator of Discovery and will hold a majority of governance \n      voting rights. Williams has committed to fund additional capital as \n      required to bring its economic ownership to 50/50. Additionally, \n      Williams at its option, may acquire a portion of KKR interests at \n      predetermined, agreed-to terms until the sixth anniversary of close. \n      Williams will use the equity method of accounting for this acquisition. \n      Williams expects the Discovery transaction to represent a 5-6 times \n      multiple to Williams\u2019 investment inclusive of additional investments of \n      approximately $250 million between 2018 and 2020 and based on expected \n      2020 EBITDA forecast; with opportunities for additional improvement \n      based upon the success of natural gas liquids (NGL) opportunities.\n     \n     \n      Discovery, whose management team is partnering with Williams and KKR to \n      continue executing for the customers of the DJ Basin, provides midstream \n      services to producers drilling the prolific Niobrara and Codell \n      stacked-pay zones of the basin. Discovery\u2019s infrastructure and related \n      facilities are strategically located in Weld and Adams counties in \n      Colorado. The Discovery system includes both natural gas and crude oil \n      gathering pipelines, cryogenic gas processing, liquids handling and \n      crude oil storage. The Discovery assets include 60 million cubic feet \n      per day (MMcf/d) of gas processing capacity with an additional 200 \n      MMcf/d plant that is fully permitted and under construction and is \n      expected to be in service by the end of 2018. The Discovery assets also \n      include 130 miles of natural gas pipeline and approximately 260,000 \n      acres dedicated for gas gathering and processing plus an additional \n      60,000 acres for oil gathering.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAdding the fast-growing Discovery midstream business, including sites \n      with permitting underway for greater than 1 Bcf/d of gas processing to \n      our portfolio, follows our strategy of connecting the best supplies to \n      the best markets. This is a great opportunity to expand our asset \n      footprint into a premium-growth basin and brings the benefits of the \n      Williams capability suite to better serve producers in the DJ Basin. The \n      acquisition of Discovery is expected to unlock valuable synergies with \n      our current operations and drive increased earnings,\u201d said Alan \n      Armstrong, president and chief executive officer of Williams. \u201cFor \n      example, this transaction allows Williams to take advantage of synergies \n      between the Discovery assets and our downstream businesses via the DJ \n      Lateral of Overland Pass Pipeline (\u201cOPPL\u201d). We will now have the \n      opportunity to integrate output from these acquired assets with \n      production from our existing processing footprint in the West segment \n      into our advantaged downstream assets, including OPPL and the Conway \n      fractionator and storage facilities.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Concurrent with the announcement of the Discovery transaction, Williams \n      is also announcing the combined sale of assets and equity comprising \n      WPZ\u2019s Four Corners Area (\u201cFCA\u201d) business in New Mexico and Colorado to \n      Harvest Midstream Company (\u201cHarvest\u201d) for $1.125 billion in cash, \n      subject to customary closing conditions. The cash proceeds from the FCA \n      transaction will contribute to funding Williams\u2019 extensive portfolio of \n      attractive growth capital and investment expenditures, including those \n      opportunities associated with the Discovery acquisition. The FCA assets \n      being divested of by Williams are located in San Juan and Rio Arriba \n      Counties in New Mexico and in La Plata County in Colorado and include \n      3,700 miles of pipeline, two gas processing plants, and one CO 2 \u00a0treating \n      facility. In 2017, the Modified EBITDA contribution from the FCA assets \n      was approximately $85 million and is forecast to be $82 million \n      annualized in 2018. This transaction is expected to close in the second \n      half of 2018, following the closing of the previously-announced merger \n      of WPZ into WMB.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe FCA transaction is a win-win opportunity for both Williams and \n      Harvest,\u201d said Micheal Dunn, chief operating officer of Williams. The \n      sale of the FCA assets supports Williams\u2019 expansion of operations into \n      the DJ Basin and funding of future growth capital. At the same time, we \n      are pleased that an outstanding midstream services provider like Harvest \n      will be the operator of these assets and know that the employees who \n      move from Williams to Harvest will continue delivering gas gathering and \n      processing expertise that is second to none in that basin.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Armstrong added, \u201cThe Four Corners Area has been an important part of \n      Williams dating back to the acquisition of Northwest Energy in 1983. \n      However, pressure on natural gas pricing from adjacent basins like the \n      Permian, demand a new basin model that consolidates and integrates \n      upstream production with midstream operations in a way that optimizes \n      throughput and lowers cost. We believe that Harvest is ideally \n      positioned to achieve this integration, and Williams can redeploy the \n      proceeds into improved opportunities for growth. The value and multiple \n      on EBITDA that we are receiving is a testament to the high-quality \n      assets that Williams employees have grown and maintained in the basin \n      over the past 35 years.\u201d\n     \n     \n      For the Discovery acquisition, Simmons acted as the lead financial \n      adviser to both Williams and KKR; Gibson Dunn served as legal counsel to \n      Williams, and Simpson Thatcher served as legal adviser to KKR. For the \n      transaction to divest of its assets in the Four Corners Area, Williams\u2019 \n      lead financial adviser was Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk acted as legal \n      counsel.\n     \n     \n       Investor Webcast and Conference Call Aug. 2 to Discuss Second-Quarter \n      2018 Financial Results and Today\u2019s Transactions \n     \n     \n      The transactions announced today are expected to impact Williams\u2019 \n      guidance provided on May 17, 2018, for capital expenditures. Williams \n      expects to provide an update to 2018 and 2019 capital expenditures \n      guidance, including updates from today\u2019s transactions and other \n      commercial activities on the company\u2019s second-quarter 2018 earnings \n      webcast and conference call scheduled for Aug. 2, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. \n      Eastern Time (8:30 a.m. Central Time).

The favorable change was driven \n      primarily by a $68 million increase in operating income due primarily to \n      an increase in service revenues and NGL margins partially offset by the \n      absence of $25 million of operating income earned in second-quarter 2017 \n      by our former olefins operations. Other Investing Income for the quarter \n      was favorably impacted by a $62 million gain on the deconsolidation of \n      the partnership's interests in the Jackalope Gas Gathering System. \n      Partially offsetting the improvements was a $33 million decrease in \n      equity earnings primarily driven by lower earnings at Discovery Producer \n      Services.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income of $786 \n      million, a $168 million decrease from the same period in 2017. The \n      unfavorable change was driven primarily by a $202 million decrease in \n      Other Investing Income due largely to the absence of a $269 million gain \n      in first-quarter 2017 associated with a transaction involving certain \n      joint-venture interests in the Permian Basin and Marcellus Shale, \n      partially offset by a $62 million gain on the partnership's interests in \n      the Jackalope Gas Gathering System. The unfavorable change also reflects \n      a $58 million decrease in equity earnings primarily driven by lower \n      earnings at Discovery Producer Services. Partially offsetting the \n      decrease was a $110 million improvement in operating income, due \n      primarily to an increase in service revenues and NGL margins overcoming \n      the absence of $57 million of operating income earned in the first half \n      of 2017 by our former olefins operations.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.097 \n      billion, a $7 million decrease from second-quarter 2017. The change was \n      driven by a $37 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint \n      ventures due primarily to less production on the Discovery system, the \n      absence of $23 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in second-quarter 2017 \n      from the NGL & Petchem Services segment primarily as a result of the \n      sale of the Geismar olefins facility, and $28 million increased \n      operating & maintenance (O&M) expenses at the partnership's continuing \n      businesses primarily due to increased reliability and integrity costs at \n      Transco. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $46 million increase \n      in service revenues, driven primarily by expansion projects brought \n      online by Transco in 2017 and 2018. Second-quarter 2018 service revenues \n      would have increased by $67 million over second-quarter 2017 if \n      revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been applied to \n      second-quarter 2017 results. Additionally, NGL and Marketing margins \n      improved by $35 million. Williams Partners' current business segments \n      increased Adjusted EBITDA by $18 million in second quarter 2018 vs. \n      second-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.219 \n      billion, a decrease of $2 million from the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2017. The modest change was driven by the absence of $72 \n      million Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2017 from the NGL & Petchem Services \n      segment primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins \n      facility, a $60 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint \n      ventures due primarily to less production on the Discovery system, $42 \n      million increased O&M expenses at the partnership's continuing \n      businesses primarily due to increased reliability and integrity costs at \n      Transco, and a $12 million regulatory charge per approved pipeline \n      transportation rates associated with the Tax Reform Act. Partially \n      offsetting these decreases was $125 million of increased service \n      revenues, driven primarily by expansion projects brought online by \n      Transco in 2017 and 2018. Service revenue would have increased by $165 \n      million over first half of 2017 if revenue-recognition standards adopted \n      in 2018 had been applied to first-half 2017 results. Additionally, NGL \n      and Marketing margins improved by $49 million. Year-to-date, Williams \n      Partners' current business segments increased Adjusted EBITDA by $71 \n      million vs. the same reporting period in 2017.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For second-quarter 2018, Williams Partners generated $705 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $698 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for second-quarter 2017. DCF was unfavorably impacted by the \n      partnership's change in Adjusted EBITDA and by a $52 million increase in \n      maintenance capital expenditures primarily due to accelerated \n      inspections and other key maintenance needs moved into this quarter to \n      take advantage of timing of outages associated with expansion \n      construction work. Beginning with first-quarter 2018 results, the \n      partnership has discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF \n      associated with 2016 contract restructuring prepayments in the Barnett \n      Shale and Mid-Continent region. For second-quarter 2018, the cash \n      distribution coverage ratio was 1.17x.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners generated $1.489 billion in DCF, a $39 \n      million increase over the same period in 2017. The adjustment described \n      in the previous paragraph involving the removal of DCF associated with \n      2016 contract restructuring prepayments in the Barnett Shale and \n      MId-Continent region positively impacted year-to-date DCF results. DCF \n      was unfavorably impacted by a $99 million increase in maintenance \n      capital expenditures primarily due to accelerated inspections and other \n      key maintenance needs moved into the first half of 2018 to take \n      advantage of timing of outages associated with expansion construction \n      work. The cash distribution coverage ratio for the first six-month \n      reporting period was 1.25x.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.629 per unit, payable Aug. 10, 2018, to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 3, 2018.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \"Our consistent strategy of connecting growing natural gas demand to \n      growing low-cost gas production delivered results which slightly \n      exceeded our business plan for second quarter, and we look forward to an \n      even stronger second half of the year as the Atlantic Sunrise project \n      nears completion and producer activity on our systems in the Northeast \n      and Wyoming is ramping up. We are also excited about the transactions \n      announced earlier this week. Selling assets in a maturing basin at \n      attractive multiples, and redeploying that capital to higher growth \n      basins enhances our position to capitalize on future growth \n      opportunities and follows our strategy to connect the best supplies to \n      the best markets.\n     \n     \n      \"It is clear that our focus on natural gas volume growth combined with \n      our advantaged infrastructure and the continued confidence in low-price \n      natural gas continues to drive demand for services on our systems. \n      Placing the Transco expansion projects into service in 2017 and 2018 is \n      now delivering exceptional fee-based revenue growth - a $50 million \n      increase for second-quarter 2018 over second-quarter 2017 for Transco \n      transportation revenues thanks to those expansion projects coming \n      online. Our growth was not limited to Transco as Williams Partners' \n      current business segments posted year-over-year increases in Adjusted \n      EBITDA for the quarter and year-to-date.\n     \n     \n      \"I'm pleased our teams were able to complete so much maintenance work \n      this quarter, especially in our high-growth areas where we accelerated \n      inspections and other key maintenance needs into this quarter to take \n      advantage of the timing of outages associated with expansion \n      construction work and project work - particularly important in \n      association with a project like Atlantic Sunrise, which is preparing to \n      bring additional loads on to that system. I'm proud of our team's \n      exceptional focus on safety and environmental compliance throughout the \n      construction and commissioning process on this large and complex project.\n     \n     \n      \"We are also making great progress on several other projects. In \n      Wyoming, we just announced an expansion on our Jackalope Gas Gathering \n      System and associated Bucking Horse gas processing facility in the \n      Powder River Basin, Niobrara Shale play that will increase processing \n      capacity to 345 million cubic feet per day ('MMcf/d') by the end of 2019 \n      to meet growing customer demand in this underserved growth basin. We \n      also completed major modifications to our Mobile Bay processing plant to \n      enable the handling of large volumes of gas liquids from Shell's \n      Norphlet fields in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, a major \n      expansion of our Oak Grove gas-processing facility in West Virginia is \n      also underway. Construction is going well on Transco's Gulf Connector \n      project, and we realized great progress on the permitting of several \n      other Transco projects in the Northeast and Northwest Pipeline in \n      Seattle.\"\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      For second-quarter 2018 results, Williams Partners' operations are \n      comprised of the following reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, and \n      Northeast G&P. Following the sale of Williams Partners' ownership \n      interest in the Geismar olefins plant on July 6, 2017, the partnership's \n      NGL\u00a0& Petchem Services segment no longer contained any

Partners uses Modified EBITDA for its segment reporting. \n          Definitions of Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules \n          reconciling these measures to net income are included in this news \n          release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is developing a \n      pipeline project, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $475 million for \n      second-quarter 2018, compared with $454 million for second-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6 million to $456 million for the same \n      time period. The improvement in Modified EBITDA reflects $43 million \n      increased service revenues driven primarily by Transco's 'Big 5' \n      expansion projects placed into service in 2017 as well as mainline \n      service on Atlantic Sunrise in 2018. The quarter was also favorably \n      impacted by a $20 million benefit associated with the Tax Reform Act. \n      Partially offsetting these increases were a $36 million decrease in \n      proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a significant \n      decline in volumes on the deepwater Discovery system's Hadrian field and \n      a $16 million increase in O&M expenses mainly related to pipeline \n      integrity program costs. The adjustment associated with the Tax Reform \n      Act discussed in this paragraph is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $926 \n      million, an increase of $22 million over the same six-month period in \n      2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased $7 million to $922 million. The \n      improvement in Modified EBITDA reflects $116 million increased service \n      revenues due primarily to Transco expansion projects led by the 'Big 5' \n      placed into service in 2017 as well as mainline service on Atlantic \n      Sunrise in 2018. Partially offsetting this increase was a $65 million \n      decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a \n      significant decline in volumes on the deepwater Discovery system's \n      Hadrian field and a $39 million increase in O&M expenses mainly related \n      to pipeline integrity program costs.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL and a 50 percent interest in \n      Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope) (an equity-method \n      investment following deconsolidation as of June 30, 2018). The \n      partnership completed the sale of its 50 percent equity-method \n      investment in a Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent \n      region during first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $389 million for \n      second-quarter 2018, compared with $356 million for second-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $17 million to $389 million. The increase \n      in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by a $37 million improvement in \n      NGL and marketing margins due to favorable prices. Partially offsetting \n      the increases was a $10 million unfavorable change in other income and \n      expense primarily driven by a $6 million regulatory charge per approved \n      pipeline transportation rates associated with the Tax Reform Act. \n      Additionally, service revenue declined by $7 million, primarily due to \n      lower rates at Northwest Pipeline per its 2017 rate settlement \n      agreement, while the favorable impact of higher volumes was offset by an \n      unfavorable change in recognition of deferred revenue driven by the \n      adoption of new accounting standards in 2018. Second-quarter 2018 \n      service revenues would have increased by $14 million over second-quarter \n      2017 if the new revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been \n      applied to second-quarter 2017 results, which would have reduced \n      second-quarter 2017 results by $21 million. The variance in Adjusted \n      EBITDA between the periods was $16 million less favorable than the \n      variance in Modified EBITDA primarily due to the fact that Adjusted \n      EBITDA for both periods included estimated minimum volume commitments \n      (MVCs). While estimated MVCs were not recognized in Modified EBITDA \n      until the fourth quarter in 2017, with the adoption of new accounting \n      standards, estimated MVC revenue is recognized earlier in 2018 Modified \n      EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $802 million, \n      an increase of $61 million over the same six-month period in 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million to $795 million. The increase \n      in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by $52 million increased NGL and \n      marketing margins. Partially offsetting this increase was a $12 million \n      regulatory charge per approved pipeline transportation rates associated \n      with the Tax Reform Act, and a $9 million decline in service revenue, \n      which includes the favorable impact of higher volumes offset by the \n      unfavorable change in recognition of deferred revenue driven by the \n      adoption of new accounting standards in 2018. First-half 2018 service \n      revenues would have increased by $31 million over first-half 2017 \n      results if revenue-recognition standards adopted in 2018 had been \n      applied to first half 2017 results, which would have reduced first half \n      2017 results by $40 million. The variance in Adjusted EBITDA between the \n      periods was $27 million less favorable than the variance in Modified \n      EBITDA primarily due to the fact that Adjusted EBITDA for both periods \n      included estimated MVCs. While estimated MVCs were not recognized in \n      Modified EBITDA until the fourth quarter in 2017, with the adoption of \n      new accounting standards, estimated MVC revenue is recognized earlier in \n      2018 Modified EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel \n      Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and \n      Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 \n      percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in \n      the Marcellus Shale.\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $255 million for \n      second-quarter 2018, compared with $247 million for second-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $7 million to $255 million. The improvement \n      in both measures was driven primarily by $15 million increased service \n      revenues due to higher volumes at the Susquehanna and Ohio River systems.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $505 \n      million, an increase of $32 million over the same six-month period in \n      2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $30 million to $505 million. The \n      improvements in both measures was driven primarily by $26 million \n      increased service revenues due to higher volumes at the Susquehanna and \n      Ohio River systems, and a $9 million increase in proportional EBITDA of \n      joint ventures due largely to the partnership's increase in ownership in \n      two Marcellus Shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017. Partially \n      offsetting these improvements was a $4 million increase in O&M expenses.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      In second-quarter 2017, this segment produced $30 million in Modified \n      EBITDA and $23 million in Adjusted EBITDA. For the first six-month \n      reporting period of 2017, this segment produced $81 million in Modified \n      EBITDA and $72 million in Adjusted EBITDA. As of July 7, 2017, this \n      segment no longer contained any operating assets following the sale of \n      the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       Williams and Williams Partners Announce Meeting and Record Dates for \n      Williams Special Meeting \n     \n     \n      On July 12, 2018, Williams and Williams Partners announced that, in \n      connection with the previously announced merger transaction between \n      Williams and Williams Partners (the \"Merger\"), the registration \n      statement on Form S-4 (the \"Registration Statement\") has been declared \n      \"effective\" by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). \n      Following effectiveness of the Registration Statement, on July 13, 2018, \n      Williams Gas Pipeline Company, LLC, which owns units representing \n      approximately 73.8 percent of the outstanding units of Williams \n      Partners, delivered a written consent approving and adopting the Merger \n      Agreement and the Merger. As a result, no further action by any \n      unitholder of Williams Partners is required to adopt the Merger \n      Agreement and the Merger. The closing of the Merger remains subject to \n      customary closing conditions, including approval by the Williams \n      stockholders. On July 12, 2018, Williams announced that it has scheduled \n      a special meeting of Williams stockholders on Aug. 9, 2018, to vote on \n      the proposed Merger and related amendment of Williams Amended and \n      Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares \n      of Williams common stock.\n     \n     \n       Williams Companies Inc.

A limited number of phone lines will be available at (877) \n      260-1479. International callers should dial (334) 323-0522. The \n      conference ID is 1766230. The link to the webcast, as well as replays of \n      the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days following the event \n      at  \n www.williams.com \n .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its second-quarter 2018 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners \n      websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash \n      distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as \n      defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The unfavorable change was driven \n      primarily by the absence of a $269 million gain in first-quarter 2017 \n      associated with a transaction involving certain joint-venture interests \n      in the Permian basin and Marcellus shale. Commodity margins were $59 \n      million lower due primarily to the absence of margins from the Geismar \n      olefins facility, which was sold July 6, 2017. The unfavorable change \n      also reflects the absence of $43 million of gains on early retirement of \n      debt and contract settlements and terminations, and $25 million lower \n      equity earnings due primarily to lower earnings at Discovery Producer \n      Services. Partially offsetting the decreases were $90 million increased \n      service revenues due primarily to Transco expansions and higher gathered \n      volumes in the partnership's West business segment and $28 million lower \n      operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and administrative \n      (SG&A) expenses.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.122 \n      billion, a $5 million increase over first-quarter 2017. The \n      partnership's current business segments improved by $53 million over the \n      same time period in 2017, driven by $58 million increased revenues from \n      Transco expansion projects being placed into service in 2017 and 2018 \n      and a $14 million increase in natural gas liquids margins. Partially \n      offsetting the increases was a $23 million decrease in proportional \n      EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a significant decline in \n      volumes on the Discovery system. The improvement from the current \n      business segments was partially offset by the absence of $49 million \n      Adjusted EBITDA earned in first-quarter 2017 from the NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar \n      olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For first-quarter 2018, Williams Partners generated $784 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $752 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for first-quarter 2017. DCF was favorably impacted by the partnership's \n      change in Adjusted EBITDA and a $12 million decrease in net interest \n      expense. DCF was unfavorably impacted by a $47 million increase in \n      maintenance capital expenditures. Beginning with first-quarter 2018 \n      results, the partnership has discontinued the adjustment which removed \n      the DCF associated with 2016 contract restructuring prepayments in the \n      Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. This first-quarter 2017 \n      adjustment to DCF was a reduction of $58 million. For first-quarter \n      2018, the cash distribution coverage ratio was 1.33x.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.614 per unit, payable May 11, 2018, to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2018.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe organization utilized our stable foundation of advantaged positions \n      to deliver another impressive quarter of steady growth driven once again \n      by our consistent fee-based revenue growth as all three of our current \n      business segments demonstrated year-over-year improvement in Adjusted \n      EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe demand for low-cost U.S. natural gas continues to increase as \n      reflected in the year-over-year growth in fee-based revenues that \n      occurred thanks in large part to our \u2018Big 5\u2019 Transco expansions being \n      placed into service last year. And that demand continues as we recently \n      filed our application with FERC for our Southeastern Trail expansion \n      project, another fully-subscribed Transco expansion.\n     \n     \n      \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased with our project execution and operational \n      performance in 2018. Already this year, we have set one- and three-day \n      delivery records on Transco, established three new volume records on our \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub, started construction on the Gulf Connector\u2019s 475 \n      MMcf/d Gulf Coast LNG delivery expansion, reached several key milestones \n      on the 1,700 MMcf/d Atlantic Sunrise project, placed Phase 2 of the \n      Garden State Transco expansion into service, and also placed additional \n      gathering expansions into service on our Susquehanna Supply Hub in \n      Pennsylvania and Wamsutter Gathering System in Wyoming.\n     \n     \n      \u201cNo one is as well positioned as Williams to capture the ongoing demand \n      growth of natural gas in the U.S., and we look forward to updating \n      investors about our significant achievements and plans for the future at \n      our Analyst Day event May 17.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      For first-quarter 2018 results, Williams Partners' operations are \n      comprised of the following reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, and \n      Northeast G&P. Following the sale of Williams Partners' ownership \n      interest in the Geismar olefins plant on July 6, 2017, the partnership's \n      NGL\u00a0& Petchem Services segment no longer contained any

\n         \n           Williams Partners uses Modified EBITDA for its segment reporting. \n          Definitions of Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules \n          reconciling these measures to net income are included in this news \n          release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is developing a \n      pipeline project, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $451 million for \n      first-quarter 2018, compared with $450 million for first-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $466 million for the same \n      time period. Modified EBITDA reflects a $58 million increase in revenues \n      due to Transco expansions being placed into service, partially offset by \n      a $29 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due \n      primarily to a significant decline in volumes on the Discovery system's \n      Hadrian field and an increase in segment expenses mainly related to \n      pipeline integrity program costs. Modified EBITDA was also unfavorably \n      impacted by an $11 million non-cash adjustment to the regulatory \n      liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax \n      Reform Act\"), which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the \n      sale of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin gas \n      gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $413 million for \n      first-quarter 2018, compared with $385 million for first-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $17 million to $406 million. Gathered \n      volumes were higher in nine of 10 franchises versus first-quarter 2017. \n      Increased fee-based revenue from higher volumes was partially offset by \n      lower rates charged by Northwest Pipeline under its 2017 rate \n      stipulation and settlement agreement. The improvement also reflects $16 \n      million increased commodity margins, and a decrease in segment expenses \n      partially offset by decreased proportional EBITDA from joint ventures, \n      due in part to the partnership's sale of its interests in certain \n      non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel \n      Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and \n      Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 \n      percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in \n      the Marcellus Shale.\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $250 million for \n      first-quarter 2018, compared with $226 million for first-quarter 2017. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $23 million to $250 million. The \n      improvement was driven primarily by $11 million increased fee-based \n      revenues due in large part to higher volumes from the partnership's \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio River Supply Hub. Results for the \n      current year also benefited from an $11 million increase in proportional \n      EBITDA of joint ventures due largely to the partnership's increase in \n      ownership in two Marcellus shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017 \n      as well as higher volumes gathered by those systems.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      In first-quarter 2017, this segment produced $51 million in Modified \n      EBITDA and $49 million in Adjusted EBITDA. As of July 7, 2017, this \n      segment no longer contained any operating assets following the sale of \n      the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       2018 Guidance \n     \n     \n      The partnership's guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, \n      expected distribution growth, cash distribution coverage ratio, and debt \n      to EBITDA remains unchanged. The partnership continues to identify \n      attractive new growth capital projects and plans to provide an update on \n      its capital expenditures guidance for these new projects at its annual \n      Analyst Day event. These new projects are expected to contribute to \n      EBITDA for 2019 and beyond.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners, Williams Analyst Day Set for May 17 \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams are scheduled to host their 2018 Analyst \n      Day event May 17, 2018.

A limited number of phone lines will be available at (888) \n      394-8218. International callers should dial (323) 794-2149. The \n      conference ID is 8527513. The link to the webcast, as well as replays of \n      the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days following the event \n      at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its first-quarter 2018 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners \n      websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash \n      distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as \n      defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures.

The unfavorable change was driven primarily by the \n      absence of a $269 million gain in first-quarter 2017 associated with a \n      transaction involving certain joint-venture interests in the Permian \n      basin and Marcellus shale. Commodity margins were $59 million lower due \n      primarily to the absence of margins from the Geismar olefins facility, \n      which was sold July 6, 2017. The unfavorable change also reflects the \n      absence of $43 million of gains on early retirement of debt and contract \n      settlements and terminations, and $25 million lower equity earnings due \n      primarily to lower earnings at Discovery Producer Services. Partially \n      offsetting the decreases were $90 million increased service revenues due \n      primarily to Williams Partners' Transco expansions and higher gathered \n      volumes in the Williams Partners' West business segment and $43 million \n      lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and \n      administrative (SG&A) expenses. The year-over-year change also includes \n      a modest increase in income tax expense reflecting the absence of a $127 \n      million prior-year benefit from the expected utilization of a capital \n      loss carryover and a reduction in income attributable to noncontrolling \n      interests.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported first-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.135 billion, \n      a $10 million decrease from first-quarter 2017. Williams Partners' \n      current business segments improved by $53 million over the same period \n      in 2017, driven by $58 million increased revenues from Williams \n      Partners' Transco expansion projects being placed into service in 2017 \n      and 2018 and a $14 million increase in natural gas liquids margins. \n      Partially offsetting the increases was a $23 million decrease in \n      proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily to a significant \n      decline in volumes on the Discovery system. The improvement from \n      Williams Partners' current business segments was partially offset by the \n      absence of $49 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in first-quarter 2017 from \n      Williams Partners' former NGL & Petchem Services business segment \n      primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on \n      July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe organization utilized our stable foundation of advantaged positions \n      to deliver another impressive quarter of steady growth driven once again \n      by our consistent fee-based revenue growth as all three of our current \n      business segments demonstrated year-over-year improvement in Adjusted \n      EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe demand for low-cost U.S. natural gas continues to increase as \n      reflected in the year-over-year growth in fee-based revenues that \n      occurred thanks in large part to our \u2018Big 5\u2019 Transco expansions being \n      placed into service last year. And that demand continues as we recently \n      filed our application with FERC for our Southeastern Trail expansion \n      project, another fully-subscribed Transco expansion.\n     \n     \n      \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased with our project execution and operational \n      performance in 2018. Already this year, we have set one- and three-day \n      delivery records on Transco, established three new volume records on our \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub, started construction on the Gulf Connector\u2019s 475 \n      MMcf/d Gulf Coast LNG delivery expansion, reached several key milestones \n      on the 1,700 MMcf/d Atlantic Sunrise project, placed Phase 2 of the \n      Garden State Transco expansion into service, and also placed additional \n      gathering expansions into service on our Susquehanna Supply Hub in \n      Pennsylvania and Wamsutter Gathering System in Wyoming.\n     \n     \n      \u201cNo one is as well positioned as Williams to capture the ongoing demand \n      growth of natural gas in the U.S., and we look forward to updating \n      investors about our

The midstream business provides natural gas \n      gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL \n      production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; \n      deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and \n      is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries \n      and joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first-quarter 2018 Modified EBITDA of $1.107 \n      billion, a decrease of $25 million from first-quarter 2017. The \n      unfavorable change was driven by lower commodity margins primarily \n      reflecting the absence of margins from the Geismar olefins facility, \n      which was sold July 6, 2017, the absence of $43 million of gains on \n      early retirement of debt and contract settlements and terminations, and \n      $25 million lower proportional EBITDA from joint ventures due primarily \n      to lower earnings at Discovery Producer Services. Partially offsetting \n      the decreases were $58 million of increased revenues from Williams \n      Partners' Transco expansions and higher gathered volumes in Williams \n      Partners' West business segment and $31 million lower O&M and SG&A \n      expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5 million to $1.122 billion.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for first-quarter 2018 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       2018 Guidance \n     \n     \n      Williams' guidance remains unchanged.

A limited number of phone lines will be available at (888) \n      394-8218. International callers should dial (323) 794-2149. The \n      conference ID is 8527513.

Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), \n      adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends and other \n      uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend coverage ratio, economic coverage \n      ratio, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to \n      include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow in \n      excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, cash available for dividends \n      and other uses or distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash \n      flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net \n      income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in \n      isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in \n      accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

 \n      Williams reported unaudited fourth-quarter 2017 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $1.687 billion, an improvement of $1.702 billion from \n      fourth-quarter 2016. The favorable change was driven primarily by the \n      remeasurement of Williams' deferred tax liabilities to reflect lower \n      future tax payments expected due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 \n      (\"Tax Reform Act\"). This resulted in the recognition of an income tax \n      provision benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017. In \n      addition, the absence of a $318 million impairment of equity method \n      investments from fourth-quarter 2016 is also reflected in the \n      improvement. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of $713 \n      million of non-cash charges at Williams Partners' Transco and Northwest \n      Pipeline primarily related to regulatory liabilities resulting from the \n      Tax Reform Act.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams reported unaudited net income of $2.174 billion, \n      a favorable change of $2.598 billion over the corresponding 12-month \n      reporting period in 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by the \n      net impact of the Tax Reform Act as described in the previous paragraph, \n      a $1.095 billion gain associated with the sale of our ownership interest \n      in the Geismar olefins facility, the absence of impairments of \n      equity-method investments and higher revenues from Williams Partners' \n      Atlantic-Gulf business. Partially offsetting the improvement was a net \n      increase in impairments of certain assets and the absence of results \n      associated with the Geismar olefins facility, which was sold July 6, \n      2017.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported fourth-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.160 billion, \n      a $37 million increase from fourth-quarter 2016. Williams Partners' \n      current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $84 million in \n      fourth-quarter 2017 vs. fourth-quarter 2016, driven in large part by \n      $117 million increased fee-based revenues, due primarily to the growth \n      in fee-based revenues in Williams Partners' Atlantic-Gulf and West \n      businesses partially offset by $30 million in higher operating and \n      maintenance (O&M) expenses. The $84 million improvement from Williams \n      Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $47 \n      million Adjusted EBITDA earned in fourth-quarter 2016 from the NGL & \n      Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the sale of the \n      Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $4.531 billion, an \n      increase of $95 million over fiscal 2016. The current businesses in the \n      Williams Partners segment increased Adjusted EBITDA by $202 million in \n      2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by $147 \n      million increased fee-based revenues driven primarily from new assets \n      brought online by the Atlantic-Gulf business in the Williams Partners \n      segment. Full-year 2017 results for the Williams Partners segment also \n      benefited from $51 million increased commodity margins and $28 million \n      from higher EBITDA from joint ventures, partially offset by $63 million \n      higher O&M expenses. The $202 million improvement from Williams \n      Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $157 \n      million Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services \n      business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins \n      facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \"I am pleased with the organization's strong execution in 2017. Our \n      organization has been working hard to keep its promises to our \n      customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders with timely and safe \n      delivery of our projects, including Transco\u2019s \u2018Big 5\u2019 projects (Gulf \n      Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside \n      II). This is reflected in our financial results where we exceeded the \n      midpoint of our guidance range for Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and Cash \n      Coverage ratios.\n     \n     \n      \"We achieved these impressive results, which include improvement in \n      year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA for both fourth-quarter and full-year \n      2017, in spite of the impact of multiple hurricanes and more than $3 \n      billion in asset sales since September 2016. Our stable foundation of \n      demand-driven expansions continues to grow our business. In 2018, we \n      look forward to a full year of revenue from our \u2018Big 5\u2019 as well as \n      contributions from our Atlantic Sunrise project later this year and the \n      associated growth in Northeast gathering volumes.\n     \n     \n      \"We also carried out our financial repositioning in January of 2017 in a \n      way that positioned the company to fund an attractive slate of \n      large-scale expansion projects without accessing public equity markets, \n      strengthened distribution coverage, enhanced our credit profile, \n      improved our cost of capital and underpinned our growth outlook. As a \n      result of a full year of executing on the key aspects of our plan, we \n      reduced Williams consolidated debt for the year by $3.3 billion and \n      dramatically reduced our commodity exposure.\n     \n     \n      \"As the Atlantic Sunrise project construction continues, the \n      debottlenecking of the Northeast is starting to occur as other pipelines \n      in the Northeast have also been placed in service recently or will be \n      brought online in the near future. We are beginning to see some of the \n      key fundamentals of our strategy take shape in the Northeast where we \n      have a leading market share and a path to deliver long-term sustainable \n      shareholder value. Volumes are increasing and our focus on executing the \n      company\u2019s natural gas-focused business strategy is producing predictable \n      fee-based revenue growth backed by long-term commitments.\"\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners and Other.\n     \n     \n

Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules \n          reconciling to net income are included in this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Comprised of our consolidated master limited partnership, WPZ, Williams \n      Partners segment includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. The gas \n      pipeline business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline \n      joint project investments. The midstream business provides natural gas \n      gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL \n      production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; \n      deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and \n      is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries \n      and joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported fourth-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of $408 \n      million, a decrease of $827 million from fourth-quarter 2016. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the impact \n      of $713 million of non-cash charges at the segment's Transco and \n      Northwest Pipeline primarily related to regulatory liabilities \n      established as a result of the recently enacted Tax Reform Act. Some of \n      the rates charged to customers of our regulated natural gas pipelines \n      are subject to periodic FERC rate case filings, which permit the \n      recovery of an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax \n      component in our recourse rates. As a result of the reduced income tax \n      rate from the Tax Reform Act and the resulting regulatory liabilities, \n      we expect that any future rate case settlements or proceedings before \n      the FERC will be impacted by this lower income tax allowance. However, \n      the actual amount and timing of any return of this regulatory liability \n      to customers will be subject to negotiations in future rate proceedings. \n      We expect that the amortization of the regulatory liability will be over \n      an extended period of time (as much as 20 years or more). Considering \n      all of these recourse rate-making elements, Transco still expects to \n      file for increased cost-of-service rates in its upcoming initial rate \n      filing in 2018.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million to $1.150 billion. The non-cash \n      charges associated with the Tax Reform Act did not impact 2017 Adjusted \n      EBITDA. Williams Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA \n      by $84 million in fourth-quarter 2017 vs. fourth-quarter 2016, driven by \n      $117 million increased fee-based revenues, due primarily to the growth \n      in fee-based revenues in Williams Partners' Atlantic-Gulf and West \n      businesses, partially offset by $30 million in higher O&M and selling, \n      general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The $84 million improvement \n      from Williams Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the \n      absence of $47 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in fourth-quarter 2016 \n      from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the \n      sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $3.616 \n      billion, a decrease of $248 million compared to results for full-year \n      2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.472 billion, a $45 million increase over \n      the corresponding 12-month reporting period. The unfavorable change in \n      Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the non-cash charges resulting \n      from the Tax Reform Act as described in the previous paragraph. Results \n      were also negatively impacted by impairments of assets, largely offset \n      by the gain related to the sale of the Geismar facility. The non-cash \n      charges associated with the Tax Reform Act did not impact 2017 Adjusted \n      EBITDA. Williams Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA \n      by $202 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was driven \n      primarily by $147 million increased fee-based revenues driven largely by \n      new assets brought online by the Atlantic-Gulf segment. Williams \n      Partners' full-year 2017 results also benefited from $51 million \n      increased commodity margins and $28 million higher EBITDA from joint \n      ventures, partially offset by $63 million higher O&M expenses. The $202 \n      million improvement from Williams Partners' current businesses was \n      partially offset by the absence of $157 million Adjusted EBITDA earned \n      in 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result \n      of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for fourth-quarter and \n      full-year 2017 are provided in the earnings news release issued today by \n      Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 Other segment reported fourth-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of \n      ($90) million, a decrease of $82 million from fourth-quarter 2016, \n      driven by a $63 million regulatory charge associated with the Tax Reform \n      Act. Adjusted EBITDA remained stable at $10 million.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams\u2019 Other segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($150) \n      million, an increase of $392 million due primarily to the absence of a \n      second-quarter 2016, $406 million impairment charge associated with the \n      company's former Canadian business that was sold in September \n      2016.\u00a0Adjusted EBITDA realized a $50 million improvement to $59 million. \n      Both measures benefited from $29 million of higher income associated \n      with a regulatory asset, and was primarily driven by our increased \n      ownership in WPZ.\n     \n     \n       Notable Accomplishments \n     \n     \n      On Dec. 5, 2017, the Williams Partners segment announced that it had \n      successfully placed into service its Virginia Southside II expansion \n      project, the fifth of Transco\u2019s \u201cBig 5\u201d expansions to be placed into \n      service in 2017. These five, fully-contracted expansion projects (Gulf \n      Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside II) \n      combined to add more than 2.8 million dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of firm \n      transportation capacity to the Transco pipeline system in 2017, \n      contributing to the increase of Transco\u2019s design capacity by \n      approximately 25 percent.\n     \n     \n       Williams' Credit Profile Update \n     \n     \n      The company strengthened its balance sheet and credit profile during the \n      year with an over $500 million reduction of the Williams Companies' \n      corporate-level debt in addition to the nearly $2.1 billion debt \n      reduction at Williams Partners and more than $700 million increase in \n      consolidated cash. As of the end of 2017, Williams had corporate level \n      debt of $4.4 billion, in addition to Williams Partners' debt of $16.5 \n      billion and consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $899 million, \n      which the company intends to use primarily to fund growth capital \n      expenditures and long-term investments at Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       2018 Guidance \n     \n     \n      Current guidance for 2018 is set out in the following table. As noted in \n      the table below, Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable \n      Cash Flow estimates for 2018 have recently been impacted by non-cash \n      adjustments related to the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and Tax \n      Reform Act. For Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA, the unfavorable \n      non-cash impacts of these two items were approximately $120 million for \n      the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and approximately $30 million \n      for tax reform primarily due to Northwest Pipeline even though rates on \n      Northwest Pipeline remain unchanged until the next rate case cycle \n      expected to occur in 2021.\n     \n     \n      The main effect of the new GAAP revenue recognition standard was to \n      extend the amortization of deferred revenue associated with certain 2016 \n      contract restructurings and pre-payments by approximately 10 years \n      resulting in lower 2018 and 2019 revenue and then higher revenue amounts \n      through 2029. Furthermore, as a result of the extended revenue \n      amortization period under the new GAAP revenue standard, we have \n      prospectively discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF \n      associated with these 2016 contract restructuring prepayments. \n      Consequently, DCF is expected to be approximately $140 million higher in \n      2018 than it otherwise would have been absent this prospective change.\n     \n     \n      For Williams, the above-described 2018 guidance for Williams Partners \n      will support 10 to 15 percent dividend growth and at least 1.35x \n      dividend-coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n             Amounts in billions, except per-unit cash distribution, cash \n            dividend and coverage ratio amounts. \n \n All income \n            amounts attributable to Williams Partners LP. \n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Williams Partners \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           2018 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Net income (1)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1.5-$1.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2)(3)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $4.45-$4.65\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Distributable Cash Flow (1)(2)(4)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $2.9-$3.2\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio (1)(2)(4)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          ~1.2x (midpoint of guidance)\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Distribution Growth Rate (3)\n\n           \n            (Quarterly Distribution Increases)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          5-7% annual growth for 2018 and 2019\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Total Growth Capital Expenditures\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $2.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Transco Growth Capital Expenditures\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Leverage (5)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          < 4.5x\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       \n         \n           \n            (1)\n           \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           \n            Assumes 2018 WTI oil price of approximately $59.00 per barrel and \n            Henry Hub natural gas price of approximately $2.80 per mmbtu.\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n            (2)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            For Williams Partners, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow \n            and Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio are non-GAAP measures and for \n            Williams, Dividend Coverage Ratio is a non-GAAP measure; \n            reconciliations to the most relevant measures are attached to this \n            news release.\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n            (3)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            Includes $0.15 billion unfavorable effects of new revenue \n            recognition standard and tax reform.

The link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast, \n      will be available for at least 90 days following the event at  \n www.williams.com \n .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-K \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its 2017 Form 10-K with the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission (SEC) next week. Once filed, the document will be \n      available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), \n      adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends and other \n      uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend coverage ratio, economic coverage \n      ratio, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to \n      include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow in \n      excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      For Williams Partners L.P., we define distributable cash flow as \n      Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of \n      interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and \n      cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation \n      expense and certain other adjustments that management believes affects \n      the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital \n      expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our \n      proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, cash available for dividends \n      and other uses or distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash \n      flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net \n      income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in \n      isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in \n      accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The unfavorable change was \n      driven primarily by the impact of $713 million of non-cash charges at \n      Transco and Northwest Pipeline primarily related to regulatory \n      liabilities established as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and \n      Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform Act\"). Some of the rates charged to \n      customers of our regulated natural gas pipelines are subject to periodic \n      FERC rate case filings, which permit the recovery of an income tax \n      allowance that includes a deferred income tax component in our recourse \n      rates. As a result of the reduced income tax rate from the Tax Reform \n      Act and the resulting regulatory liabilities, we expect that any future \n      rate case settlements or proceedings before the FERC will be impacted by \n      this lower income tax allowance. However, the actual amount and timing \n      of any return of this regulatory liability to customers will be subject \n      to negotiations in future rate proceedings. We expect that the \n      amortization of the regulatory liability will be over an extended period \n      of time (as much as 20 years or more). Considering all of these recourse \n      rate-making elements, Transco still expects to file for increased \n      cost-of-service rates in its upcoming initial rate filing in 2018. \n      Fourth-quarter 2017 results were positively impacted by the absence of \n      an impairment on equity method investments in fourth-quarter 2016.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income \n      attributable to controlling interests of $871 million, a $440 million \n      improvement compared to full-year 2016 results. The favorable change was \n      driven primarily by gains on the sale of assets, the absence of \n      impairments of equity-method investments, and higher revenues for the \n      Atlantic-Gulf segment. Partially offsetting the increases was the impact \n      of the non-cash charges related to the Tax Reform Act as described in \n      the previous paragraph, a net increase in impairments of certain assets, \n      and the absence of results associated with the Geismar olefins facility, \n      which was sold July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported fourth-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.150 \n      billion, a $37 million increase over fourth-quarter 2016. Williams \n      Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $84 million in \n      fourth-quarter 2017 vs. fourth-quarter 2016, driven by $117 million \n      increased fee-based revenues, due primarily to the growth in fee-based \n      revenues in the Atlantic-Gulf and West segments partially offset by $30 \n      million in higher operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. The $84 \n      million improvement from the current businesses was partially offset by \n      the absence of $47 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in fourth-quarter 2016 \n      from the NGL & Petchem Services segment primarily as a result of the \n      sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $4.472 \n      billion, a $45 million increase over full-year 2016 results. Williams \n      Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $202 million \n      in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was due primarily to a $147 \n      million increase in fee-based revenues driven primarily from new assets \n      brought online by the Atlantic-Gulf segment. The partnership's full-year \n      2017 results also benefited from $51 million increased commodity margins \n      and $28 million higher EBITDA from joint ventures, partially offset by \n      $63 million higher O&M expenses. The $202 million improvement from the \n      current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $157 million \n      Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services segment \n      primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on \n      July 6, 2017.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For fourth-quarter 2017, Williams Partners generated $702 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $699 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for fourth-quarter 2016. DCF was favorably impacted by the partnership's \n      change in Adjusted EBITDA and a $31 million decrease in interest \n      expense. DCF for fourth-quarter 2017 was reduced by $58 million for the \n      removal of deferred revenue amortization associated with the \n      fourth-quarter 2016 contract restructurings and prepayments in the \n      Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. For fourth-quarter 2017, the \n      cash distribution coverage ratio was 1.22x.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners generated $2.821 billion in DCF \n      attributable to partnership operations, an unfavorable change of $149 \n      million compared with full-year 2016 DCF results. For 2017, DCF was \n      reduced by $233 million for the deferred revenue amortization associated \n      with the previously described contract restructurings and prepayments. \n      Also impacting DCF for full-year 2017 was $42 million increased \n      maintenance capital expenditures. Partially offsetting these unfavorable \n      changes were a $114 million decrease in interest expense and a $45 \n      million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. As described above, the \n      partnership's Adjusted EBITDA from current businesses increased $202 \n      million, but was partially offset by $157 million lower Adjusted EBITDA \n      from assets sold. For full-year 2017, the cash distribution coverage was \n      1.23x. Both DCF and coverage exceeded the midpoint of financial guidance \n      provided in January 2017.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.60 per unit, payable Feb. 9, 2018, to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 2, 2018.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \"I am pleased with the organization's strong execution in 2017. Our \n      organization has been working hard to keep its promises to our \n      customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders with timely and safe \n      delivery of our projects, including Transco\u2019s \u2018Big 5\u2019 projects (Gulf \n      Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside \n      II). This is reflected in our financial results where we exceeded the \n      midpoint of our guidance range for Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and Cash \n      Coverage ratios.\n     \n     \n      \"We achieved these impressive results, which include improvement in \n      year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA for both fourth-quarter and full-year \n      2017, in spite of the impact of multiple hurricanes and more than $3 \n      billion in asset sales since September 2016. Our stable foundation of \n      demand-driven expansions continues to grow our business. In 2018, we \n      look forward to a full year of revenue from our \u2018Big 5\u2019 as well as \n      contributions from our Atlantic Sunrise project later this year and the \n      associated growth in Northeast gathering volumes.\n     \n     \n      \"We also carried out our financial repositioning in January of 2017 in a \n      way that positioned the company to fund an attractive slate of \n      large-scale expansion projects without accessing public equity markets, \n      strengthened distribution coverage, enhanced our credit profile, \n      improved our cost of capital and underpinned our growth outlook. As a \n      result of a full year of executing on the key aspects of our plan, we \n      reduced WPZ Net Debt for the year by 15 percent and also dramatically \n      reduced our commodity exposure.\n     \n     \n      \"As the Atlantic Sunrise project construction continues, the \n      debottlenecking of the Northeast is starting to occur as other pipelines \n      in the Northeast have also been placed in service recently or will be \n      brought online in the near future. We are beginning to see some of the \n      key fundamentals of our strategy take shape in the Northeast where we \n      have a leading market share and a path to deliver long-term sustainable \n      shareholder value. Volumes are increasing and our focus on executing the \n      company\u2019s natural gas-focused business strategy is producing predictable \n      fee-based revenue growth backed by long-term commitments.\"\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      For full-year 2017 results, Williams Partners' operations are comprised \n      of the following reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, Northeast \n      G&P, and NGL & Petchem Services. As of July 7, 2017, following the \n      completed sale of Williams Partners' ownership interest in the Geismar \n      olefins plant on July 6, 2017, the partnership's NGL\u00a0& Petchem Services \n

partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is developing a \n      pipeline project, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($96) million for \n      fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $456 million for fourth-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $21 million to $433 million for the same \n      time period. The unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was due primarily \n      to the impact of $493 million of non-cash charges at Transco primarily \n      related to regulatory liabilities resulting from the Tax Reform Act and \n      previously described in this news release. The Tax Reform Act also led \n      to non-cash charges of $11 million of proportional Modified EBITDA of \n      joint-ventures from Transco's investments. The non-cash charges \n      associated with the Tax Reform Act did not impact 2017 Adjusted EBITDA. \n      The segment benefited from a $57 million increase in fee-based revenues \n      from Transco expansion projects brought online. Partially offsetting the \n      improvement were $32 million increased O&M expenses primarily associated \n      with Transco's integrity and pipeline maintenance programs and $20 \n      million decreased proportional EBITDA from the partnership's Discovery \n      joint venture, due to a significant decline in volumes from the Hadrian \n      field. Results for fourth-quarter 2017 also reflect the absence of $22 \n      million in fee-based revenues and commodity margins from volumes \n      transported and processed by Williams Partners on a short-term basis due \n      to an unplanned outage on another company's system in 2016.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $1.238 billion, \n      a decrease of $383 million from full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA \n      increased $118 million to $1.779 billion. The unfavorable change in \n      Modified EBITDA was due primarily to the impact of the non-cash charges \n      associated with the Tax Reform Act referenced in the previous paragraph. \n      Adjusted EBITDA benefited from $132 million increased fee-based revenues \n      primarily from Transco expansion projects brought online, and a $104 \n      million improvement from Gulfstar One. Partially offsetting the \n      increases were $90 million higher O&M expenses primarily associated with \n      Transco's integrity and pipeline maintenance programs. Results for \n      full-year 2017 also reflect the absence of $42 million in fee-based \n      revenues and commodity margins from volumes transported and processed by \n      Williams Partners on a short-term basis due to an unplanned outage on \n      another company's system in 2016.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the \n      sale of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin gas \n      gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $286 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $542 million for fourth-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $87 million to $481 million. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to the impact of \n      $220 million of non-cash charges at Northwest Pipeline primarily related \n      to regulatory liabilities resulting from the Tax Reform Act and \n      previously described in this press release. Adjusted EBITDA, which is \n      not impacted by the non-cash charges associated with the Tax Reform Act, \n      benefited from $54 million higher fee-based revenues due to increased \n      volumes primarily in the Haynesville, other rate changes, and a $24 \n      million positive impact from the 2016 Barnett contract restructuring and \n      prepayment. The year-over-year comparison for the quarter also benefited \n      from $16 million improved commodity margins and $20 million in lower O&M \n      and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Partially \n      offsetting these improvements was $10 million decreased proportional \n      EBITDA from joint ventures, due in part to the partnership's sale of its \n      interests in certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter \n      2017.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $412 million, \n      a decrease of $1.132 billion from full-year 2016 results. Adjusted \n      EBITDA increased by $17 million to $1.668 billion. The unfavorable \n      change in Modified EBITDA is due primarily to a $1.019 billion \n      impairment of certain gathering operations in the Mid-Continent region \n      and the non-cash charges associated with the Tax Reform Act described in \n      the previous paragraph. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impairment charge \n      and is not impacted by the non-cash charges associated with the Tax \n      Reform Act. The favorable change in Adjusted EBITDA reflects $73 million \n      lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $54 million improved commodity margins. \n      Revenues were also impacted by lower rates associated with 2016 contract \n      restructurings and lower volumes driven by natural declines, partially \n      offset by the amortization of deferred revenue from those 2016 contract \n      restructurings and prepayments. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA reflects \n      $87 million of lower fee-based revenues. When compared to full-year 2016 \n      results, the segment was also negatively impacted by $31 million in \n      decreased proportional EBITDA of joint ventures, due in part to the \n      partnership\u2019s sale of its interests in certain non-operated Delaware \n      Basin assets in first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel \n      Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and \n      Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 \n      percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in \n      the Marcellus Shale (Appalachia Midstream Investments).\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $231 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $197 million for fourth-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19 million to $238 million. The current \n      year benefited from a $25 million increase in proportional EBITDA of \n      joint ventures due largely to the partnership's increase in ownership in \n      two Marcellus shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017. Fee-based \n      revenues were stable between the two periods due to increases in the \n      Susquehanna and Ohio River systems that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $819 \n      million, a decrease of $34 million compared with full-year 2016 results. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $73 million to $959 million. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA reflected a $115 million \n      impairment of certain gathering operations in the Marcellus South. The \n      impairment charge is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, which benefited from \n      a $71 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures due \n      largely to the partnership's increase in ownership in two Marcellus \n      shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017. Fee-based revenues were \n      stable between the two periods due to increases in the Susquehanna and \n      Ohio River systems that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      On Jan. 1, 2017, this segment included the partnership\u2019s 88.46 percent \n      undivided interest in an olefins production facility in Geismar, \n      Louisiana, along with a refinery grade propylene splitter. On July 6, \n      2017, the partnership announced that it had completed the sale of all of \n      its membership interest in the Geismar olefins production facility and \n      associated complex. On June 30, 2017 the partnership completed the sale \n      of the refinery grade propylene splitter. Prior to September 2016, this \n      reporting segment also included an oil sands offgas processing plant \n      near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility, \n      which were subsequently sold. As of July 7, 2017, this segment no longer \n      contained any operating assets.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified \n      EBITDA of $1.161 billion, an improvement of $1.306 billion compared with \n      full-year 2016 results. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $157 million to $72 \n      million. The improvement in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the \n      $1.095 billion gain resulting from the sale of the partnership's \n      interest in the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017, and the \n      absence of a $341 million impairment of our former Canadian operations \n      in 2016. These items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The current year \n      was also impacted by the absence of EBITDA associated with the \n      previously described assets that were sold by the partnership.\n     \n     \n       Notable Accomplishments \n     \n     \n      On Dec. 5, 2017, the partnership announced that it had successfully \n      placed into service its Virginia Southside II expansion project, the \n      fifth of Transco\u2019s \u201cBig 5\u201d expansions to be placed into service in 2017. \n      These five, fully-contracted expansion projects (Gulf Trace, Hillabee \n      Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside II) combined to add \n      more than 2.8 million dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of firm transportation \n      capacity to the Transco pipeline system in 2017, contributing to the \n      increase of Transco\u2019s design capacity by approximately 25 percent.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners' Credit Profile Update \n     \n     \n      The partnership continued to maintain its strengthened balance sheet and \n      credit profile with nearly $2.1 billion of Total Debt reduction and more \n      than $700 million increase in cash, year-to-date, resulting in a $2.8 \n      billion reduction in Net Debt (long-term debt plus commercial paper less \n      cash). As of the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the partnership had Total \n      Debt of $16.5 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $881 million, \n      which the partnership intends to use to fund growth capital expenditures \n      and long-term investments.\n     \n     \n       2018 Guidance \n     \n     \n      Current guidance for 2018 is set out in the following table. As noted in \n      the table below, Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable \n      Cash Flow estimates for 2018 have recently been impacted by non-cash \n      adjustments related to the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and Tax \n      Reform Act. For Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA, the unfavorable \n      non-cash impacts of these two items were approximately $120 million for \n      the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and approximately $30 million \n      for tax reform primarily due to Northwest Pipeline even though rates on \n      Northwest Pipeline remain unchanged until the next rate case cycle \n      expected to occur in 2021.\n     \n     \n      The main effect of the new GAAP revenue recognition standard was to \n      extend the amortization of deferred revenue associated with certain 2016 \n      contract restructurings and pre-payments by approximately 10 years \n      resulting in lower 2018 and 2019 revenue and then higher revenue amounts \n      through 2029. Furthermore, as a result of the extended revenue \n      amortization period under the new GAAP revenue standard, we have \n      prospectively discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF \n      associated with these 2016 contract restructuring prepayments. \n      Consequently, DCF is expected to be approximately $140 million higher in \n      2018 than it otherwise would have been absent this prospective change.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n           \n             Amounts in billions, except per-unit cash distribution, cash \n            dividend and coverage ratio amounts. \n \n All income \n            amounts attributable to Williams Partners LP. \n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Williams Partners \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           2018 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Net income (1)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1.5-$1.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2)(3)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $4.45-$4.65\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Distributable Cash Flow (1)(2)(4)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $2.9-$3.2\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio (1)(2)(4)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            ~1.2x (midpoint of guidance)\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Distribution Growth Rate (3)\n\n           \n            (Quarterly Distribution Increases)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            5-7% annual growth for 2018 and 2019\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Total Growth Capital Expenditures\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $2.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Transco Growth Capital Expenditures\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1.7\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Leverage (5)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          < 4.5x\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n            (1)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            Assumes 2018 WTI oil price of approximately $59.00 per barrel and \n            Henry Hub natural gas price of approximately $2.80 per mmbtu.\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n            (2)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            For Williams Partners, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow \n            and Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio are non-GAAP measures and for \n            Williams, Dividend Coverage Ratio is a non-GAAP measure; \n            reconciliations to the most relevant measures are attached to this \n            news release.\n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           \n            (3)\n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n            Includes $0.15 billion unfavorable effects of new revenue \n            recognition standard and tax reform.

Once filed, the document will be \n      available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release and accompanying materials may include certain \n      financial measures \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash \n      distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as \n      defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The purpose of the administrative \n      stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider an \n      emergency motion filed by project opponents last week requesting FERC \n      extend a comprehensive four-year permitting process even further.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAtlantic Sunrise has undergone a nearly four-year, extensive review \n      process and is operating and being constructed in compliance with all \n      state and federal permits,\u201d said Micheal Dunn, Williams Partners\u2019 chief \n      operating officer. \u201cThese current actions by opponents of American \n      energy are, this morning, idling thousands of workers in Pennsylvania \n      and could delay the benefits of low-cost energy delivery to millions of \n      American families.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Dunn continued: \u201cIt is important to stress that this temporary stay is \n      administrative and not related to the project\u2019s execution or its \n      compliance with applicable federal or state regulations or permit \n      conditions. It is merely intended to give the court sufficient \n      opportunity to consider the motion recently filed by project opponents \n      and is not a ruling on the merits of that motion. Our expectation is \n      that the court will expeditiously complete its review.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe have worked with countless elected officials, regulators, \n      environmental consultants and landowners to bring this vital U.S. energy \n      project to construction, and a vast majority of stakeholders understand \n      how critical these types of projects are to economic growth, jobs and \n      manufacturing expansion in addition to helping the U.S. transition away \n      from the use of higher carbon fuels.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Atlantic Sunrise pipeline construction broke ground in Pennsylvania on \n      Sept. 15, 2017. While the company has ceased construction activities \n      until the temporary stay is lifted, the company believes it is prudent \n      and will continue to maintain environmental controls related to \n      construction to remain in compliance with Federal and Pennsylvania \n      permits, while protecting the environment.\n     \n     \n      During peak construction periods, the project is anticipated to directly \n      employ approximately 2,300 people in 10 Pennsylvania counties. In \n      addition, the project could support an additional 6,000 jobs in related \n      industries and generate up to $1.6 billion in economic activity, \n      according to researchers at Pennsylvania State University.\n     \n     \n      The nearly $3 billion project, which is designed to increase natural gas \n      deliveries by 1.7 billion cubic feet per day, is expected to be placed \n      into full service in mid-2018.\n     \n     \n      Additional information about the Atlantic Sunrise project can be found \n      at  www.williams.com/atlanticsunrise .\n     \n     \n      "},

The unfavorable change was driven \n      primarily by the absence of results associated with the Geismar olefins \n      facility, which was sold July 6, 2017, and the partnership's former \n      Canadian business, which was sold in September 2016. In addition, \n      results were negatively impacted by impairments of certain assets, \n      largely offset by the gain related to the sale of the Geismar facility.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income \n      attributable to controlling interests of $1.213 billion, a $927 million \n      improvement over the same nine-month reporting period in 2016. The \n      favorable change was driven primarily by increased fee-based revenues \n      from expansion projects, and gains on the sale of assets and equity \n      investments. These favorable results were partially offset by higher \n      impairment losses on assets between the periods and the decrease related \n      to the previously mentioned sales of the Geismar olefins facility and \n      the partnership's former Canadian operations.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported third-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.101 \n      billion, an $88 million decrease from third-quarter 2016. The \n      unfavorable change was driven primarily by the absence of $101 million \n      of Adjusted EBITDA contribution from the NGL & Petchem Services segment \n      associated with the previously described assets sold. Williams Partners' \n      current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $13 \n      million including an unfavorable impact of approximately $8 million from \n      Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.322 \n      billion, an $8 million increase over the corresponding nine-month \n      reporting period in 2016. The comparison includes an approximately $110 \n      million decrease from the NGL & Petchem Services segment associated with \n      the previously described assets that were sold. Williams Partners' \n      current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $118 \n      million during the period. Favorable results included increased \n      fee-based revenues, improved commodity margins, lower selling, general \n      and administrative (SG&A) expenses and increased proportional EBITDA \n      from joint ventures. Partially offsetting the increases were higher \n      operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For third-quarter 2017, Williams Partners generated $669 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $795 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for third-quarter 2016. DCF was unfavorably impacted by the change in \n      Adjusted EBITDA described above. DCF for third-quarter 2017 was also \n      reduced by $59 million for the removal of non-cash deferred revenue \n      amortization associated with the fourth-quarter 2016 contract \n      restructurings in the Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. Partially \n      offsetting the unfavorable change was a $37 million decrease in interest \n      expense. For third-quarter 2017, the cash distribution coverage ratio \n      was 1.17x.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners generated $2.119 billion in DCF \n      attributable to partnership operations, an unfavorable change of $152 \n      million compared with the same period in 2016. DCF for 2017 was reduced \n      by $175 million for the non-cash deferred revenue amortization \n      associated with the previously described contract restructurings. Also \n      contributing to the unfavorable change was a $35 million increase in \n      maintenance capital expenditures. Partially offsetting the unfavorable \n      change was an $83 million decrease in interest expense. The cash \n      distribution coverage for the nine-month reporting period was 1.24x.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.60 per unit, payable Nov. 10, 2017, to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 3, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe large-scale, competitive positions we've established continue to \n      generate long-term value as evidenced once again this quarter as we \n      maintained our strong results with year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA \n      comparable to 2016 results despite the impact of two hurricanes and the \n      sale of over $3 billion in assets. We've substantially reduced our \n      direct exposure to commodities and, as a result, our current businesses' \n      steady growth is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategic focus on natural gas volumes continues to deliver \n      results. So far in 2017, we've placed four of our 'Big 5' Transco \n      expansion projects into service including Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, \n      Dalton Expansion and New York Bay Expansion with the fifth of the 'Big \n      5' expansions - the Virginia Southside II project - expected to be \n      placed in service during fourth-quarter 2017. The incremental capacity \n      from the fully-contracted Transco expansion projects going in service so \n      far this year reflects a 25 percent increase in Transco\u2019s design \n      capacity. And, year-to-date, Transco's transportation revenues have \n      increased $74 million, a 7 percent increase over last year.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur existing asset footprint and the efficient incremental expansions \n      available to us have also been highlighted in our Northeast G&P and West \n      segments. Our recently announced agreement to expand our services in the \n      Northeast for our valued customer, Southwestern Energy, showcases how \n      well-positioned our Northeast G&P segment is to serve the growing gas \n      production in the Marcellus and Utica. We are also positioned to capture \n      growth in the Haynesville where in August, we completed the Springridge \n      South plant expansion, and in Wyoming where we are able to bring more \n      volumes onto our Wamsutter system after placing our Chain Lake \n      compressor station into service in October to meet the growing demand of \n      a customer.\n     \n     \n      \u201cI\u2019m also extremely pleased that even as we continue to deliver on our \n      growth strategy by successfully executing on expansion projects across \n      our operational map, we have strengthened our balance sheet and credit \n      profile, significantly reducing our debt and continued to lower \n      expenses. Year-to-date in 2017, total adjusted SG&A expenses have been \n      reduced by about $40 million when compared to the same period in 2016.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Effective, Jan. 1, 2017, Williams Partners implemented certain changes \n      in its reporting segments as part of an operational realignment. As a \n      result beginning with the reporting of first-quarter 2017 financial \n      results, Williams Partners operations were comprised of the following \n      reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, Northeast G&P, and NGL & \n      Petchem Services. As of July 7, 2017, following the completed sale of \n      Williams Partners' ownership interest in the Geismar olefins plant on \n      July 6, 2017, the partnership's NGL & Petchem Services segment no longer \n      contained any operating assets.\n     \n     View Full Table  \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n

includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is under \n      development, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $430 million for \n      third-quarter 2017, compared with $423 million for third-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3 million to $431 million for the same \n      time period. The increase in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by $46 \n      million increased fee-based revenues from Transco expansion projects \n      brought online. Partially offsetting the increase were $29 million \n      increased O&M expenses primarily associated with Transco's integrity and \n      pipeline maintenance programs. Proportional EBITDA from joint ventures \n      decreased by $11 million. The total unfavorable impact to Atlantic-Gulf \n      in third-quarter 2017 related to hurricanes was over $6 million.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $1.334 billion, \n      an increase of $169 million over the same nine-month reporting period in \n      2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $139 million to $1.346 billion. \n      Fee-based revenues increased $199 million due primarily to higher \n      volumes from Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects placed in \n      service. Partially offsetting these improvements were $56 million \n      increased O&M expenses due primarily to higher costs associated with \n      Transco\u2019s integrity and pipeline maintenance programs, the segment\u2019s \n      offshore business, and costs associated with several of Transco's \n      expansion projects.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and an undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the \n      disposal of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin \n      gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter \n      2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($615) million for \n      third-quarter 2017, compared with $363 million for third-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million to $426 million. The unfavorable \n      change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by a $1.019 billion \n      impairment of certain gathering operations in the Mid-Continent region. \n      The unfavorable change also includes $11 million in decreased \n      proportional EBITDA from joint ventures, due in part to the \n      partnership's sale of its interests in certain non-operated Delaware \n      Basin assets in first-quarter 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases \n      were $19 million higher fee-based revenues, a $21 million increase in \n      commodity margins and a $12 million decline in O&M and SG&A expenses. \n      Adjusted EBITDA excludes the previously mentioned impairment charge and \n      is further adjusted for estimated minimum volume commitments. As a \n      result, Adjusted EBITDA reflects $33 million of lower fee-based \n      revenues. The West segment also experienced unfavorable impacts from \n      Hurricane Harvey of more than $1 million during third-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $126 million, \n      a decrease of $876 million from the same nine-month period in 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $70 million to $1.187 billion. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA reflected the impairment in the \n      Mid-Continent region described in the above paragraph. The unfavorable \n      change also includes $21 million in decreased proportional EBITDA of \n      joint ventures, due in part to the partnership\u2019s sale of its interests \n      in certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter 2017. \n      Partially offsetting the decreases were $59 million in reduced O&M and \n      SG&A expenses and $38 million in improved commodity margins. Revenues \n      reflect an increase from the amortization of deferred revenue from 2016 \n      contract restructurings largely offset by lower rates associated with \n      those restructurings and lower volumes driven by natural declines. \n      Adjusted EBITDA excludes the previously mentioned impairment charge and \n      is further adjusted for estimated minimum volume commitments. As a \n      result, Adjusted EBITDA reflects $141 million of lower fee-based \n      revenues.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel \n      Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and \n      Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 \n      percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in \n      the Marcellus Shale (Appalachia Midstream Investments).\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $115 million for \n      third-quarter 2017, compared with $214 million for third-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $26 million to $246 million. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA reflected a $115 million \n      impairment of certain gathering operations in the Marcellus South. This \n      impairment charge is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The current year \n      benefited from a $30 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint \n      ventures due largely to the partnership's increase in ownership in two \n      Marcellus shale gathering systems in first-quarter 2017. Fee-based \n      revenues were stable between the two periods due to increases in the \n      Susquehanna that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $588 \n      million, a decrease of $68 million over the corresponding nine-month \n      period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $54 million to $721 \n      million. The unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA reflected the \n      impairment in the Marcellus South region described in the above \n      paragraph. This impairment charge is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The \n      current year benefited from a $51 million increase in proportional \n      EBITDA of joint ventures due largely to the previously described \n      increase in ownership in two Marcellus shale gathering systems. \n      Fee-based revenues were stable between the two periods due to increases \n      in the Susquehanna and Ohio River systems that offset decreases in the \n      Utica.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      On Jan. 1, 2017, this segment included the partnership\u2019s 88.46 percent \n      undivided interest in an olefins production facility in Geismar, \n      Louisiana, along with a refinery grade propylene splitter. On July 6, \n      2017, the partnership announced that it had completed the sale of all of \n      its membership interest in the Geismar olefins production facility and \n      associated complex. On June 30, 2017 the partnership completed the sale \n      of the refinery grade propylene splitter. Prior to September 2016, this \n      reporting segment also included an oil sands offgas processing plant \n      near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility, \n      which were subsequently sold. As of July 7, 2017, this segment no longer \n      contained any operating assets.\n     \n     \n      The NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified EBITDA of $1.084 \n      billion for third-quarter 2017, compared with $70 million for \n      third-quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $101 million to $1 \n      million. The improvement in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the \n      $1.095 billion gain resulting from the sale of the partnership's \n      interest in the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017. This gain is \n      excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The current year was also impacted by the \n      absence of EBITDA associated with assets recently sold by the \n      partnership as described in the above paragraph.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified \n      EBITDA of $1.165 billion, an improvement of $1.359 billion over the same \n      nine-month reporting period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $110 \n      million to $73 million. The improvement in Modified EBITDA was driven \n      primarily by the $1.095 billion gain resulting from the sale of the \n      partnership's interest in the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017, \n      and the absence of a $341 million impairment of our former Canadian \n      operations in 2016. These items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. The \n      current year was also impacted by the absence of EBITDA associated with \n      the previously described assets that were recently sold by the \n      partnership.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic Sunrise Update \n     \n     \n      On Sept. 18, 2017 Williams Partners reported that construction is now \n      underway in Pennsylvania on the greenfield portion of the Atlantic \n      Sunrise pipeline project - an expansion of the existing Transco natural \n      gas pipeline to connect abundant Marcellus gas supplies with markets in \n      the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. The partnership anticipates \n      pipeline and compressor station construction to last approximately 10 \n      months, weather permitting. Additionally, Williams Partners also placed \n      a portion of the project into early service on Sept. 1, 2017, providing \n      400,000 dth/day of firm transportation service on Transco's existing \n      mainline facilities to various delivery points as far south as Choctaw \n      County, Alabama. The partial service milestone is the result of recently \n      completed modifications to existing Transco facilities in Virginia and \n      Maryland designed to further accommodate bi-directional flow on the \n      existing Transco pipeline system.\n     \n     \n       Additional Notable Recent Accomplishments \n     \n     \n      On Oct. 12, 2017, Williams Partners announced the execution of \n      agreements with Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) (\u201cSouthwestern\u201d) \n      to expand its services to Southwestern in the Appalachian Basin of West \n      Virginia where Williams Partners has established a strong operational \n      footprint. The agreements call for Williams Partners to deliver gas \n      processing, fractionation, and liquids handling services in \n      Southwestern\u2019s Wet Gas Acreage in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian Shale \n      along with gas gathering services for Southwestern in its South Utica \n      Dry Gas Acreage. Williams Partners will provide Southwestern with 660 \n      million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of processing capacity to serve a \n      135,000-acre dedication in Southwestern\u2019s Wet Gas Acreage in the \n      Marcellus and Upper Devonian Shale in Marshall and Wetzel counties in \n      West Virginia. As a result of this agreement, Williams Partners expects \n      to further build out its Oak Grove processing facility for \n      Southwestern\u2019s expanding production of wet gas. The Oak Grove processing \n      facility has the ability to expand by an additional 1.8 Bcf/d of gas \n      processing capacity.\n     \n     \n      On Oct. 9, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it has placed into \n      service an expansion of its Transco pipeline system to increase natural \n      gas delivery capacity to New York City by 115,000 dekatherms per day in \n      time for the 2017/2018 heating season.\u00a0The New York Bay Expansion \n      provides additional firm transportation capacity for much-needed \n      incremental natural gas supplies to National Grid, the largest \n      distributor of natural gas in the northeastern U.S. The company provides \n      service to 1.8 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and \n      Long Island. The New York Bay Expansion is the fourth of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 projected five fully-contracted Transco expansion projects to \n      be placed into service this year, combining with Gulf Trace, Hillabee \n      Phase 1 and the Dalton Expansion to add more than 2.5 million dekatherms \n      per day capacity to the Transco pipeline system so far in 2017. The \n      partnership continues to target a fourth-quarter 2017 in-service date \n      for its fifth Transco expansion this year - the Virginia Southside II \n      project.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners' Credit Profile Improvement including Debt \n      Reduction Update \n     \n     \n      The partnership continued to strengthen its balance sheet and credit \n      profile during the quarter with nearly $2.1 billion of debt \n      reduction.\u00a0As of the end of third-quarter 2017, the partnership had \n      total debt of $16.5 billion. Year-to-date, cash and cash equivalents \n      increased by $1.02 billion to $1.17 billion, which the partnership \n      intends to use primarily to fund growth capital expenditures and \n      long-term investments.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      The Guidance previously provided at our Analyst Day event on May 11, \n      2017, remains unchanged. The partnership plans to announce its 2018 \n      Guidance as part of the release of its fourth-quarter 2017 financial \n      results.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners\u2019 Third-Quarter 2017 Materials to be Posted Shortly; \n      Q&A Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 third-quarter 2017 financial results package will be \n      posted shortly at  \n www.williams.com \n . \n      Note: the analyst package is included at the back of this news release.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on \n      Thursday, Nov. 2 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (8:30 a.m. Central Time). A \n      limited number of phone lines will be available at (877) 830-2641. \n      International callers should dial (785) 424-1809. The conference ID is \n      8089866. The link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast, \n      will be available for at least 90 days following the event at  \n www.williams.com \n .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its third-quarter 2017 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners \n      websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The favorable change was driven by \n      a $452 million improvement in operating income primarily reflecting a \n      $394 million decrease in impairments of certain assets and increased \n      fee-based revenue from expansion projects. The decrease in impairments \n      includes the absence of a second-quarter 2016, $341 million impairment \n      charge associated with the partnership\u2019s now former Canadian business \n      that was sold in September 2016.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income of $954 \n      million, a $994 million improvement over the same period in 2016. The \n      favorable change was driven by a $593 million improvement in operating \n      income primarily reflecting a $399 million decrease in impairments of \n      certain assets and increased fee-based revenue from expansion projects. \n      The decrease in impairments includes the absence of the impairment \n      charge referenced above. The improvement in net income also reflects a \n      gain of $269 million associated with the disposition of certain \n      equity-method investments in 2017 and the absence of $112 million of \n      impairments of equity-method investments incurred in 2016.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.104 \n      billion, a $39 million increase over second-quarter 2016. The \n      improvement is due primarily to $18 million increased fee-based revenues \n      and a $24 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures. \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $22 million lower olefins \n      margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.221 \n      billion, an increase of $96 million over the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2016. The increase is due primarily to $36 million lower \n      operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and administrative \n      (SG&A) expenses, a $28 million improvement in other income and expense, \n      and a $29 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For second-quarter 2017, Williams Partners generated $698 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $737 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for second-quarter 2016. DCF for second-quarter 2017 has been reduced by \n      $58 million for the planned removal of non-cash deferred revenue \n      amortization associated with the fourth-quarter 2016 contract \n      restructuring in the Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. Also \n      impacting the unfavorable change were $25 million increased maintenance \n      capital expenditures and a $19 million increase in income attributable \n      to non-controlling interests. Partially offsetting the unfavorable \n      changes was the previously described improvement in the quarter\u2019s \n      Adjusted EBITDA and a $29 million decrease in interest expense. For \n      second-quarter 2017, the cash distribution coverage ratio was 1.22x.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners generated $1.450 billion in DCF, a \n      decrease of $26 million over the same period in 2016. DCF for 2017 has \n      been reduced by $116 million for the planned removal of non-cash \n      deferred revenue amortization associated with the fourth-quarter 2016 \n      contract restructuring in the Barnett Shale and Mid-Continent region. \n      Also impacting the unfavorable change were $20 million increased \n      maintenance capital expenditures and a $17 million increase in income \n      attributable to non-controlling interests. Partially offsetting the \n      unfavorable changes were the previously described improvement in \n      year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA and a $46 million decrease in interest \n      expense. The cash distribution coverage for the first six-month \n      reporting period was 1.27x.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.60 per unit, payable Aug. 11, 2017, to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 4, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe second quarter demonstrated once again the long-term, sustainable \n      benefits of our focused strategy as we recognized year-over-year growth \n      in Adjusted EBITDA for the 15 th  consecutive quarter. We met \n      or exceeded business performance expectations in all three remaining \n      business units, offset by weaker than expected performance at Geismar, \n      which was impacted by a continuing outage and lower margins. Strong \n      performance in the Atlantic-Gulf, coupled with expected growth for the \n      balance of the year, gives us confidence in achieving our prior guidance \n      on Adjusted EBITDA and DCF.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to deliver on project execution as planned for 2017. So far \n      this year, we have successfully brought into service three Transco \n      expansion projects including the 1.2 Bcf/d Gulf Trace project, the 0.8 \n      Bcf/d Hillabee Phase 1 project, and just this week, the 0.4 Bcf/d Dalton \n      Expansion project. The line of sight to future growth is evident as well \n      as we are targeting second-half 2017 in-service dates for three more \n      fully-contracted growth projects including Virginia Southside II, New \n      York Bay, and Garden State Phase 1.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn addition to strong year-over-year fee-based revenue growth in the \n      Atlantic-Gulf, we also saw gathered volumes in the West up approximately \n      4 percent versus first-quarter 2017, adjusted for the \n      Marcellus-for-Permian transaction. While pipeline takeaway constraints \n      continue to impact volumes in the Northeast, we remain well-positioned \n      for volume growth as those constraints are lifted. We\u2019re also pleased \n      our Susquehanna and Ohio River Systems delivered year-over-year \n      fee-based revenue growth. As we look ahead, around 97 percent of our \n      gross margins will come from predictable fee-based sources now that we \n      have successfully completed the sale of Geismar \u2013 reducing our commodity \n      exposure and further strengthening our natural gas-focused strategy.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to see benefits from the reorganization of our operating \n      areas and operational support functions such as safety and procurement. \n      Continuous improvement in safety performance and project execution is \n      another commitment that we are delivering on at the mid-point of 2017 \n      and will continue to focus on as we move through the second half of the \n      year.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Effective, Jan. 1, 2017, Williams Partners implemented certain changes \n      in its reporting segments as part of an operational realignment.

interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is under \n      development, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $454 million for \n      second-quarter 2017, compared with $360 million for second-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $94 million to $462 million for the same \n      reporting period. The increase in both measures was driven primarily by \n      $88 million increased fee-based revenues due primarily to higher volumes \n      from Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects placed in service, as \n      well as higher proportional EBITDA from joint ventures related to an $11 \n      million increase from Discovery. Partially offsetting the favorable \n      results were $14 million in increased O&M expenses due primarily to \n      higher costs associated with Transco\u2019s integrity and pipeline \n      maintenance program.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $904 \n      million, an increase of $162 million over the same six-month period in \n      2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $142 million to $915 million. The \n      drivers for the increase in both measures are an improvement in \n      fee-based revenues due primarily to higher volumes from Gulfstar One and \n      Transco expansion projects placed in service, $18 million higher \n      proportional EBITDA from joint ventures primarily from Discovery, and \n      $13 million higher commodity margins. Partially offsetting these \n      improvements were increased O&M expenses due primarily to higher costs \n      associated with Transco\u2019s integrity and pipeline maintenance program and \n      the segment\u2019s offshore business.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, an undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the \n      sale of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin gas \n      gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter 2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $356 million for \n      second-quarter 2017, compared with $312 million for second-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $52 million to $372 million. The increase \n      in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the absence of $48 million of \n      impairments that impacted second-quarter 2016, which are excluded from \n      Adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to \n      $51 million lower fee-based revenues, including $18 million lower \n      fee-based revenues in the Barnett from lower volumes and contract \n      changes that occurred during 2016. Revenues in the Niobrara decreased by \n      $7 million due to a change in revenue recognition timing resulting from \n      contract restructuring. The unfavorable change in Adjusted EBITDA was \n      also impacted by $10 million in decreased proportional EBITDA of joint \n      ventures, due in part to the partnership\u2019s sale of its interests in \n      certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter 2017. Volume \n      decreases in other areas also contributed to the unfavorable change. \n      Partially offsetting the decrease was a $14 million decline in O&M and \n      SG&A expenses.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $741 million, \n      an increase of $102 million over the same six-month period in 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $63 million to $761 million. The increase \n      in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by a $65 million improvement in \n      other income and expense, which included the absence of the impairments \n      that impacted second-quarter 2016 and are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. \n      The favorable change also reflects $46 million in reduced O&M and SG&A \n      expenses, $8 million of which are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA \n      measure. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by $108 \n      million lower fee-based revenues, including $44 million lower fee-based \n      revenues in the Barnett from lower volumes and contract changes that \n      occurred during 2016. Revenues in the Niobrara decreased by $17 million \n      due to a change in revenue recognition timing resulting from contract \n      restructuring. The unfavorable change in Adjusted EBITDA was also \n      impacted by $10 million in decreased proportional EBITDA of joint \n      ventures, due in part to the partnership\u2019s sale of its interests in \n      certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets in first-quarter 2017. Volume \n      decreases in other areas also contributed to the unfavorable change. \n      Partially offsetting the decreases were the reduced O&M and SG&A \n      expenses described above and $17 million in improved commodity margins.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in Utica East Ohio Midstream (UEOM), a 69 percent \n      equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method \n      investment in Caiman II, and Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which \n      owns an approximate average 66 percent equity-method investment in \n      multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale (Appalachia \n      Midstream Investments).\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $247 million for \n      second-quarter 2017, compared with $222 million for second-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $26 million to $248 million. The \n      improvement in both measures was driven primarily by a $22 million \n      increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures due largely to the \n      partnership\u2019s increase in ownership in two Marcellus shale gathering \n      systems in first-quarter 2017. Fee-based revenues were stable between \n      the two periods due to increases in the Susquehanna and Ohio River \n      systems that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $473 \n      million, an increase of $31 million over the same six-month period in \n      2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $28 million to $475 million. The \n      improvement in both measures was driven primarily by a $21 million \n      increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures due largely to the \n      partnership\u2019s increase in ownership in two Marcellus shale gathering \n      systems in first-quarter 2017. Fee-based revenues were stable between \n      the two periods due to increases in the Susquehanna and Ohio River \n      systems that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      On Jan. 1, 2017 this segment included the partnership\u2019s 88.46 percent \n      undivided interest in an olefins production facility in Geismar, \n      Louisiana, along with a refinery grade propylene splitter. On July 6, \n      2017, the partnership announced that it had completed the sale of all of \n      its membership interest in the Geismar olefins production facility and \n      associated complex. On June 30, 2017 the partnership completed the sale \n      of the refinery grade propylene splitter. Prior to September 2016, this \n      reporting segment also included an oil sands offgas processing plant \n      near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility, \n      which were subsequently sold.\n     \n     \n      The NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified EBITDA of $30 \n      million for second-quarter 2017, compared with ($290) million for \n      second-quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $28 million to $23 \n      million. The favorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by \n      the absence of a second-quarter 2016, $341 million impairment charge \n      associated with Williams Partners\u2019 now former Canadian business that was \n      sold in September 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by a \n      $22 million decrease in olefins margins due primarily to lower volumes \n      at the Geismar olefins plant due to an unexpected power outage at the \n      plant that resulted in the facility being offline from March 12 until \n      restarting on April 18, 2017. Lower volumes at the RGP Splitter in \n      connection with its sale on June 30 also contributed to the unfavorable \n      change. The quarter\u2019s unfavorable change in Adjusted EBITDA also \n      reflects a $19 million decrease in fee-based revenues due primarily to \n      the third-quarter 2016 sale of the partnership\u2019s now former Canadian \n      business. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $15 million \n      reduction in O&M and SG&A expenses due primarily to the September 2016 \n      sale of the partnership\u2019s now former Canadian business.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified \n      EBITDA of $81 million, an improvement of $345 million over the same \n      six-month period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $9 million to $72 \n      million. The favorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by \n      the absence of a second-quarter 2016, $341 million impairment charge \n      associated with Williams Partners\u2019 now former Canadian business that was \n      sold in September 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by a \n      $24 million decrease in fee-based revenues and a $22 million decrease in \n      olefins margins due primarily to lower volumes. The Geismar olefins \n      plant had lower volumes due to the previously described power outage. \n      The segment\u2019s lower fee-based revenues and olefins margins also reflect \n      the sale of the partnership\u2019s now former Canadian business in September \n      2016. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $28 million reduction \n      in O&M and SG&A expenses due primarily to the third-quarter 2016 sale of \n      Williams Partners\u2019 now former Canadian business.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners does not expect significant future operating results \n      from this segment; however, as a result of the sale of its interest in \n      the Geismar olefins facility referenced above, the partnership expects \n      to record a gain of approximately $1.1 billion in the third quarter of \n      2017.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic Sunrise Update \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners received notice to proceed on the mainline portion of \n      the project, and construction activities are underway. In third-quarter \n      2017, the partnership expects to begin early mainline service and to \n      receive final permits on the greenfield portion of the project. Williams \n      Partners continues to target mid-2018 for the project\u2019s full in-service \n      date.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      The Guidance previously provided at our Analyst Day event on May 11, \n      2017, remains unchanged.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners\u2019 Second-Quarter 2017 Materials to be Posted \n      Shortly; Q&A Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 second-quarter 2017 financial results package will be \n      posted shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The materials will include the analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on \n      Thursday, Aug. 3 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (8:30 a.m. Central \n      Daylight Time).

The link to the webcast, as well as replays of \n      the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days following the event \n      at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its second-quarter 2017 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners \n      websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

        \n       \n     \n     \n       Third-Quarter 2017 Financial Results \n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited third-quarter 2017 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $33 million, an unfavorable change of $28 million from \n      third-quarter 2016. The unfavorable change was driven primarily by the \n      absence of results associated with the Geismar olefins facility, which \n      was sold July 6, 2017, and our former Canadian business, which was sold \n      in September 2016. In addition, results were negatively impacted by \n      impairments of assets, largely offset by the gain related to the sale of \n      the Geismar facility.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported an unaudited net income of $487 million, \n      an improvement of $896 million over the same period in 2016. The \n      favorable change was driven primarily by increased fee-based revenues \n      from expansion projects, and gains on the sale of assets and equity \n      investments. These favorable results were partially offset by higher \n      impairment losses on assets between the periods and the decrease related \n      to the previously mentioned sale of the Geismar olefins facility and the \n      September 2016 sale of our former Canadian operations. Provision for \n      income taxes also increased, driven by higher pre-tax income, partially \n      offset by a $127 million benefit associated with the expected \n      utilization of a capital loss carryover.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported third-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.113 billion, \n      a $79 million decrease from third-quarter 2016. The unfavorable change \n      was driven primarily by the absence of $101 million of Adjusted EBITDA \n      contribution from the Williams Partners segment associated with the \n      previously described assets sold. Williams Partners' remaining \n      businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $13 million \n      including an unfavorable impact of approximately $8 million from \n      Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.371 billion, an \n      increase of $58 million over the corresponding nine-month reporting \n      period in 2016. The improvement is primarily associated with favorable \n      changes in Williams' Other segment. The Williams Partners segment \n      reported an improvement of $8 million over the corresponding period with \n      increased Adjusted EBITDA from current businesses of approximately $118 \n      million, being partially offset by $110 million of reduced EBITDA \n      resulting from the previously described assets sold.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe large-scale, competitive positions we've established continue to \n      generate long-term value as evidenced once again this quarter as we \n      maintained our strong results with year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA \n      comparable for the Williams Partners segment to 2016 results despite the \n      impact of two hurricanes and the sale of over $3 billion in assets. \n      We've substantially reduced our direct exposure to commodities and, as a \n      result, our current businesses' steady growth is being driven by \n      consistent fee-based revenue growth.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategic focus on natural gas volumes continues to deliver \n      results. So far in 2017, we've placed four of our 'Big 5' Transco \n      expansion projects into service including Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, \n      Dalton Expansion and New York Bay Expansion with the fifth of the 'Big \n      5' expansions - the Virginia Southside II project - expected to be \n      placed in service during fourth-quarter 2017. The incremental capacity \n      from the fully-contracted Transco expansion projects going in service so \n      far this year reflects a 25 percent increase in Transco\u2019s design \n      capacity. And, year-to-date, Transco's transportation revenues have \n      increased $74 million, a 7 percent increase over last year.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur existing asset footprint and the efficient incremental expansions \n      available to us have also been highlighted in Williams Partners' \n      Northeast G&P and West Operating Areas. Our recently announced agreement \n      to expand our services in the Northeast for our valued customer, \n      Southwestern Energy, showcases how well-positioned our Northeast G&P \n      segment is to serve the growing gas production in the Marcellus and \n      Utica. We are also positioned to capture growth in the Haynesville where \n      in August, we completed the Springridge South plant expansion, and in \n      Wyoming where we are able to bring more volumes onto our Wamsutter \n      system after placing our Chain Lake compressor station into service in \n      October to meet the growing demand of a customer.\n     \n     \n      \u201cI\u2019m also extremely pleased that even as we continue to deliver on our \n      growth strategy by successfully executing on expansion projects across \n      our operational map, we have strengthened our balance sheet and credit \n      profile, significantly reducing our debt and continued to lower \n      expenses. Year-to-date in 2017, total adjusted SG&A expenses have been \n      reduced by about $40 million when compared to the same period in 2016.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners and Other. In September 2016, Williams announced organizational \n      changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational \n      alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive \n      continued focus on customer service and execution. Effective, Jan. 1, \n      2017, Williams implemented these changes which combined the management \n      of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating \n      areas managed within our business.

Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Comprised of our consolidated master limited partnership, WPZ, Williams \n      Partners segment includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. The gas \n      pipeline business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline \n      joint project investments. The midstream business provides natural gas \n      gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL \n      production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; \n      deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and \n      is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries \n      and joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported third-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of $1 \n      billion, a decrease of $70 million from third-quarter 2016. Adjusted \n      EBITDA decreased by $88 million to $1.101 billion. The unfavorable \n      change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the absence of results \n      associated with the Geismar olefins facility, which was sold July 6, \n      2017, and the partnership's former Canadian business, which was sold in \n      September 2016. In addition, results were negatively impacted by \n      impairments of assets, largely offset by the gain related to the sale of \n      the Geismar facility. The impairments and gain on sale are excluded from \n      Adjusted EBITDA. The current year also reflected an unfavorable impact \n      of approximately $8 million from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $3.208 \n      billion, an increase of $579 million over the same nine-month reporting \n      period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.322 billion, an $8 million \n      increase over the corresponding nine-month reporting period. The \n      favorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by increased \n      fee-based revenues from expansion projects and gains on the sale of \n      assets and equity investments. The current year also benefited from \n      improved commodity margins, higher fee-based revenues, lower selling, \n      general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and increased proportional \n      EBITDA from joint ventures. These favorable results were partially \n      offset by higher impairment losses on assets between the periods and the \n      reduced contribution related to the previously mentioned sales.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for third-quarter 2017 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 Other segment reported third-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of \n      ($61) million, an improvement of $6 million from third-quarter 2016 due \n      primarily to the absence of unfavorable results from certain former \n      Canadian operations that were sold in September 2016, partially offset \n      by a $68 million impairment of an NGL pipeline in the Gulf Coast region \n      in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA realized a $9 million improvement to $12 \n      million.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams\u2019 Other segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($60) \n      million, an increase of $474 million primarily reflecting the absence of \n      a $406 million impairment charge in 2016 associated with our former \n      Canadian business, partially offset by $91 million of impairments in \n      2017, including the previously described impairment of an NGL pipeline. \n      The increase also reflects the absence of unfavorable results from our \n      former Canadian operations and a decrease in expenses associated with \n      our evaluation of strategic alternatives. Adjusted EBITDA realized a $50 \n      million improvement to $49 million.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic Sunrise Update \n     \n     \n      On Sept. 18, 2017, Williams Partners reported that construction is now \n      underway in Pennsylvania on the greenfield portion of the Atlantic \n      Sunrise pipeline project - an expansion of the existing Transco natural \n      gas pipeline to connect abundant Marcellus gas supplies with markets in \n      the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern U.S. The partnership anticipates \n      pipeline and compressor station construction to last approximately 10 \n      months, weather permitting. Additionally, Williams Partners also placed \n      a portion of the project into early service on Sept. 1, 2017, providing \n      400,000 dth/day of firm transportation service on Transco's existing \n      mainline facilities to various delivery points as far south as Choctaw \n      County, Alabama. The partial service milestone is the result of recently \n      completed modifications to existing Transco facilities in Virginia and \n      Maryland designed to further accommodate bi-directional flow on the \n      existing Transco pipeline system.\n     \n     \n       Additional Notable Recent Accomplishments \n     \n     \n      On Oct. 12, 2017, Williams Partners announced the execution of \n      agreements with Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) (\u201cSouthwestern\u201d) \n      to expand its services to Southwestern in the Appalachian Basin of West \n      Virginia where Williams Partners has established a strong operational \n      footprint. The agreements call for Williams Partners to deliver gas \n      processing, fractionation, and liquids handling services in \n      Southwestern\u2019s Wet Gas Acreage in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian Shale \n      along with gas gathering services for Southwestern in its South Utica \n      Dry Gas Acreage. Williams Partners will provide Southwestern with 660 \n      million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of processing capacity to serve a \n      135,000-acre dedication in Southwestern\u2019s Wet Gas Acreage in the \n      Marcellus and Upper Devonian Shale in Marshall and Wetzel counties in \n      West Virginia. As a result of this agreement, Williams Partners expects \n      to further build out its Oak Grove processing facility for \n      Southwestern\u2019s expanding production of wet gas. The Oak Grove processing \n      facility has the ability to expand by an additional 1.8 Bcf/d of gas \n      processing capacity.\n     \n     \n      On Oct. 9, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it has placed into \n      service an expansion of its Transco pipeline system to increase natural \n      gas delivery capacity to New York City by 115,000 dekatherms per day in \n      time for the 2017/2018 heating season.\u00a0The New York Bay Expansion \n      provides additional firm transportation capacity for much-needed \n      incremental natural gas supplies to National Grid, the largest \n      distributor of natural gas in the northeastern U.S. The company provides \n      service to 1.8 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and \n      Long Island. The New York Bay Expansion is the fourth of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 projected five fully-contracted Transco expansion projects to \n      be placed into service this year, combining with Gulf Trace, Hillabee \n      Phase 1 and the Dalton Expansion to add more than 2.5 million dekatherms \n      per day capacity to the Transco pipeline system so far in 2017. The \n      partnership continues to target a fourth-quarter 2017 in-service date \n      for its fifth Transco expansion this year - the Virginia Southside II \n      project.\n     \n     \n       Williams' Credit Profile Improvement including Debt Reduction Update \n     \n     \n      The company continued to strengthen its balance sheet and credit profile \n      during the quarter with $144 million reduction of the Williams \n      Companies' corporate-level debt in addition to the nearly $2.1 billion \n      debt reduction at Williams Partners.\u00a0As of the end of third-quarter \n      2017, Williams had corporate level debt of $4.6 billion, in addition to \n      Williams Partners' debt of $16.5 billion. Year-to-date, consolidated \n      cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.0 billion to $1.17 billion, \n      which the company intends to use primarily to fund growth capital \n      expenditures and long-term investments at Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      The Guidance previously provided at our Analyst Day event on May 11, \n      2017, remains unchanged. Williams plans to announce its 2018 Guidance as \n      part of the release of its fourth-quarter 2017 financial results.\n     \n     \n       Williams\u2019 Third-Quarter 2017 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A \n      Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 third-quarter 2017 financial results package will be posted \n      shortly at  \n www.williams.com \n . \n      Note: the analyst package is included at the back of this news release.\n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners will host a joint Q&A live webcast on \n      Thursday, Nov. 2 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (8:30 a.m. Central Time).

Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash \n      available for dividends and other uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend \n      coverage ratio, and economic coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP \n      financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to \n      include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow in \n      excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the \n      period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash \n      flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as \n      substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with \n      United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

\n     \n       Second-Quarter 2017 Financial Results \n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited second-quarter 2017 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $81 million, an improvement of $486 million over \n      second-quarter 2016. The favorable change was driven by an $869 million \n      improvement in operating income primarily reflecting a $777 million \n      decrease in impairments of certain assets and increased fee-based \n      revenue from expansion projects. The decrease in impairments includes \n      the absence of $747 million of impairments recognized in 2016 related to \n      our former Canadian operations. These favorable changes are partially \n      offset by unfavorable changes in income tax provision and income \n      attributable to non-controlling interests, both driven by higher income.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported unaudited net income attributable to \n      Williams of $454 million, an improvement of $924 million over the same \n      period in 2016. The favorable change was driven by a $1.04 billion \n      improvement in operating income primarily reflecting a $784 million \n      decrease in impairments of certain assets and increased fee-based \n      revenue from expansion projects. The decrease in impairments includes \n      the absence of the impairment charges referenced above. The improvement \n      in net income also reflects a gain of $269 million associated with the \n      disposition of certain equity-method investments in 2017 and the absence \n      of $112 million of impairments of certain equity-method investments in \n      2016. These favorable changes are partially offset by unfavorable \n      changes in income tax provision and income attributable to \n      non-controlling interests, both driven by higher income. The unfavorable \n      change in income tax provision includes a $127 million benefit \n      associated with the expected utilization of a capital loss carryover.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported second-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.113 billion, \n      a $48 million increase over second-quarter 2016. The improvement is due \n      primarily to $18 million increased fee-based revenues at Williams \n      Partners and a $24 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint \n      ventures in the Williams Partners segment. Partially offsetting these \n      increases were $22 million lower olefins margins in the Williams \n      Partners segment.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.258 billion, an \n      increase of $137 million over the same six-month reporting period in \n      2016. The favorable change is primarily driven by the Williams Partners \n      segment, which reflects $36 million lower operating and maintenance \n      (O&M) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, a $28 \n      million improvement in other income and expense, and a $29 million \n      increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe second quarter demonstrated once again the long-term, sustainable \n      benefits of our focused strategy as we recognized year-over-year growth \n      in Adjusted EBITDA for the 15 th  consecutive quarter. We met \n      or exceeded business performance expectations in Williams Partners\u2019 \n      remaining businesses, offset by weaker-than-expected performance at \n      Geismar, which was impacted by a continuing outage and lower margins. \n      Strong performance in the Atlantic-Gulf, coupled with expected growth \n      for the balance of the year, gives us confidence in achieving our prior \n      guidance on Adjusted EBITDA and DCF.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to deliver on project execution as planned for 2017. So far \n      this year, we have successfully brought into service three Transco \n      expansion projects including the 1.2 Bcf/d Gulf Trace project, the 0.8 \n      Bcf/d Hillabee Phase 1 project, and just this week, the 0.4 Bcf/d Dalton \n      Expansion project. The line of sight to future growth is evident as well \n      as we are targeting second-half 2017 in-service dates for three more \n      fully-contracted growth projects including Virginia Southside II, New \n      York Bay, and Garden State Phase 1.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn addition to year-over-year fee-based revenue growth in the \n      Atlantic-Gulf, we also saw gathered volumes in the West up approximately \n      4 percent versus first-quarter 2017, adjusted for the \n      Marcellus-for-Permian transaction. While pipeline takeaway constraints \n      continue to impact volumes in the Northeast, we remain well-positioned \n      for volume growth as those constraints are lifted. We\u2019re also pleased \n      our Susquehanna and Ohio River Systems delivered year-over-year \n      fee-based revenue growth. As we look ahead, around 97 percent of our \n      gross margins will come from predictable fee-based sources now that we \n      have successfully completed the sale of Geismar \u2013 reducing our commodity \n      exposure and further strengthening our natural gas-focused strategy.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to see benefits from the reorganization of our operating \n      areas and operational support functions such as safety and procurement. \n      Continuous improvement in safety performance and project execution is \n      another commitment that we are delivering on at the mid-point of 2017 \n      and will continue to focus on as we move through the second half of the \n      year.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners and Other. In September 2016, Williams announced organizational \n      changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational \n      alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive \n      continued focus on customer service and execution. Effective, Jan. 1, \n      2017, Williams implemented these changes which combined the management \n      of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating \n      areas managed within our business. As a result of this realignment and \n      the sale of our Canadian operations, the Williams NGL & Petchem Services \n      reporting segment has been eliminated and the remaining assets are \n      reported with Other.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Williams \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Modified

\n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Comprised of our consolidated master limited partnership, WPZ, the \n      Williams Partners segment includes gas pipeline and midstream \n      businesses. The gas pipeline business includes interstate natural gas \n      pipelines and pipeline joint project investments. The midstream business \n      provides natural gas gathering, treating, processing and compression \n      services; NGL production, fractionation, storage, marketing and \n      transportation; deepwater production handling and crude oil \n      transportation services; a former olefin production business, and is \n      comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries and \n      joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      The Williams Partners segment reported second-quarter 2017 Modified \n      EBITDA of $1.076 billion, an increase of $472 million from \n      second-quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $39 million to $1.104 \n      billion. The favorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by \n      the absence of a second-quarter 2016, $341 million impairment charge \n      associated with Williams Partners\u2019 now former Canadian business that was \n      sold in September 2016. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA is due \n      primarily to $18 million increased fee-based revenues and a $24 million \n      increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures. Partially offsetting \n      these increases were $22 million lower olefins margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Williams Partners segment reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $2.208 billion, an improvement of $649 million over the same six-month \n      reporting period in 2016. The favorable change was driven by the absence \n      of a second-quarter 2016, $341 million impairment charge associated with \n      Williams Partners\u2019 now former Canadian business that was sold in \n      September 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $96 million to $2.221 \n      billion. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA is due primarily to $36 \n      million lower O&M and SG&A expenses, a $28 million improvement in other \n      income and expense, and a $29 million increase in proportional EBITDA of \n      joint ventures. Partially offsetting these increases were lower \n      fee-based revenues in the West and NGL & Petchem segments.\n     \n     \n      On July 6, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it had completed the \n      sale of all of its membership interest in the Geismar olefins production \n      facility and associated complex.

We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to \n      include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow in \n      excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the \n      period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash \n      flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as \n      substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with \n      United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The favorable change was driven by a \n      $271 million increase in investing income, primarily associated with a \n      transaction involving certain joint-venture interests, as well as a $141 \n      million improvement in operating income and the absence of $112 million \n      of impairments of equity-method investments in 2016.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first-quarter 2017 Cash Flow from Operations \n      (CFFO) of $731 million, a $193 million decrease from first-quarter 2016. \n      The decrease from the prior year is driven by the absence of $198 \n      million of cash received in 2016 associated with minimum volume \n      commitments, which were replaced by contract restructurings that \n      occurred in the latter part of 2016. The prior year also included $80 \n      million of cash received as a milestone payment associated with \n      Transco\u2019s Hillabee expansion project. These unfavorable changes in CFFO \n      were partially offset by improved operating results.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.117 \n      billion, a $57 million increase over first-quarter 2016. The increase is \n      due primarily to $37 million higher commodity margins and $30 million \n      lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and \n      administrative (SG&A) expenses, and a $16 million favorable change in \n      other income and expense primarily related to our former Canadian \n      operations which were sold in September 2016. Partially offsetting these \n      increases was a $30 million decrease in fee-revenues due primarily to \n      lower West segment results, partially offset by increases in the \n      Atlantic-Gulf segment.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For first-quarter 2017, Williams Partners generated $752 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $739 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for first-quarter 2016. The increase is due primarily to the previously \n      described improvement in the quarter\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA and $17 million \n      lower interest expense. DCF has been reduced by $58 million for the \n      planned removal of non-cash deferred revenue amortization associated \n      with the fourth-quarter 2016 contract restructuring in the Barnett Shale \n      and Mid-Continent region. For first-quarter 2017, the cash distribution \n      coverage ratio was 1.33x.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.60 per unit, payable May 12, 2017 to its common \n      unitholders of record at the close of business on May 5, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to differentiate ourselves with a focused strategy on \n      natural gas infrastructure in support of consistent and sustainable \n      growth in gas volumes. We continue to deliver top quartile EBITDA growth \n      among our peers as we increased year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA for the \n      14th quarter in a row. This quarter, our growth was delivered despite \n      some significant impacts from third-party outages and more extreme \n      weather in the Rockies area, proving once again the resiliency of our \n      business model.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur project teams continued to deliver as we brought on the 1.2 Bcf/D \n      Gulf Trace project ahead of schedule and under budget. That is just one \n      of five Transco pipeline system expansions that we expect to place in \n      service in 2017. Our successful 2016 work to bring the Gunflint and \n      Kodiak tiebacks in service was showcased this quarter by Atlantic-Gulf\u2019s \n      higher volumes and higher fee-based revenues. And our backlog of \n      projects continues to grow as we had a very successful Southeastern \n      Trail open season in the quarter as well.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to strengthen our foundation for long-term, sustainable \n      growth in our core business, as highlighted by the recently announced \n      agreement to sell our interests in the Geismar olefins facility while \n      gaining a new third party fee-based revenue stream for our Bayou Ethane \n      system. With the expected sale of Geismar, and the sale of our Canadian \n      business in late 2016, we\u2019ll realize around 97 percent of our gross \n      margins coming from predictable, fee-based sources.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur consolidation of operating areas from five to three became \n      effective in first-quarter 2017 \u2013 not only streamlining our \n      organization, but helping us continue the cost-savings momentum we began \n      in the second quarter of last year. We expect to realize further cost \n      savings through the consolidation of offices and systems.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Effective, Jan. 1, 2017, Williams Partners implemented certain changes \n      in its reporting segments as part of an operational realignment. As a \n      result beginning with the reporting of first-quarter 2017 financial \n      results, Williams Partners operations will be comprised of the following \n      reportable segments:

interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Transco, and significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude \n      oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast \n      region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated \n      entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, and various \n      petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, as well \n      as a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 41 percent \n      interest in Constitution (a consolidated entity) which is under \n      development, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic-Gulf segment reported Modified EBITDA of $450 million for \n      first-quarter 2017, compared with $382 million for first-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $48 million to $453 million for the same \n      time period. The increase in both measures was driven primarily by \n      higher fee-based revenues due primarily to contributions from offshore \n      expansion projects completed during 2016 and new Transco projects Rock \n      Springs (in service in August 2016) and Gulf Trace (in service in \n      February 2017). Also contributing to the increase in both measures were \n      $12 million improved commodity margins. Partially offsetting these \n      increases were increased O&M expenses due primarily to higher costs \n      associated with Transco\u2019s integrity and pipeline maintenance program.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s interstate natural gas pipeline, \n      Northwest Pipeline, and natural gas gathering, processing, and treating \n      operations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, as well as the Barnett \n      Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of \n      south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and \n      the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware \n      and Permian basins. This reporting segment also includes an NGL and \n      natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, and undivided 50 \n      percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 \n      percent equity-method investment in OPPL. The partnership completed the \n      disposal of its 50 percent equity-method investment in a Delaware Basin \n      gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region during first-quarter \n      2017.\n     \n     \n      The West segment reported Modified EBITDA of $385 million for \n      first-quarter 2017, compared with $327 million for first-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA of $389 million is $11 million lower than the same \n      period in 2016. The increase in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by \n      $35 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $21 million higher commodity \n      margins. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was due primarily to $57 million \n      lower fee-based revenues including $25 million lower fee-based revenues \n      in the Barnett from lower volumes and contract changes that occurred \n      during 2016. Fee-based revenues were also impacted by more extreme \n      weather in 2017.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and \n      processing, compression and NGL fractionation businesses in the \n      Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and West \n      Virginia and Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 66 percent \n      interest in Cardinal (a consolidated entity), a 62 percent equity-method \n      investment in UEOM, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel \n      Mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in Caiman II, and \n      Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, which owns an approximate average 66 \n      percent equity-method investment in multiple gas gathering systems in \n      the Marcellus Shale (Appalachia Midstream Investments).\n     \n     \n      The Northeast G&P segment reported Modified EBITDA of $226 million for \n      first-quarter 2017, compared with $220 million for first-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million to $227 million. The increase in \n      both measures was due primarily to lower SG&A expenses. Fee-based \n      revenues and proportional EBITDA from joint ventures were stable between \n      the two periods due to increases in the Bradford, Susquehanna and Ohio \n      River systems that offset decreases in the Utica.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      This segment includes the partnership\u2019s 88.46 percent undivided interest \n      in an olefins production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, along with a \n      refinery grade propylene splitter. On April 17, 2017, the partnership \n      announced an agreement to sell the subsidiary that owns its interests in \n      the Geismar olefins production facility. Prior to September 2016, this \n      reporting segment also included an oil sands offgas processing plant \n      near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility, \n      which were subsequently sold.\n     \n     \n      The NGL & Petchem Services segment reported Modified EBITDA of $51 \n      million for first-quarter 2017, compared with $26 million for \n      first-quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $19 million to $49 \n      million. The increase in both measures was due primarily to a favorable \n      change in other income and expense related to our former Canadian \n      operations, which were sold in September 2016. Additionally, lower O&M \n      and SG&A expenses positively impacted the quarter. Ethylene margins were \n      stable between the two periods due to favorable 2017 per-unit ethylene \n      margins offsetting lower 2017 production volumes caused by an unexpected \n      power outage and related repair activities.   The unplanned \n      shutdown and subsequent repair work resulted in the Geismar olefins \n      plant being offline from March 12 until restarting on April 18, 2017. \n      For first-quarter 2017, the Geismar plant contributed approximately $37 \n      million in Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       Notable Recent Events \n     \n     \n      On March 30, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it had completed \n      separate transactions with Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) \n      (\u201cWestern Gas\u201d), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) \n      (\u201cAnadarko\u201d), and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) (\u201cEnergy \n      Transfer\u201d), and certain of their respective affiliates, for an aggregate \n      cash consideration of $200 million paid to Williams Partners and an \n      increase in Williams Partners\u2019 ownership in two Marcellus shale \n      gathering systems, in exchange for Williams Partners\u2019 assignment of \n      interests in certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets.\n     \n     \n      On April 17, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it has agreed to \n      sell 100 percent of its membership interests in Williams Olefins LLC, \n      which owns an 88.46 percent undivided ownership interest in the Geismar, \n      Louisiana, olefins plant and associated complex, to NOVA Chemicals for \n      $2.1 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in summer \n      2017. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory \n      approvals. Additionally, upon closing of the transaction, Williams \n      Partners subsidiaries will enter into long-term supply and \n      transportation agreements with NOVA Chemicals to provide feedstock to \n      the Geismar olefins plant via Williams Partners\u2019 ethane pipeline system \n      in the U.S. Gulf Coast. These agreements will secure a meaningful \n      long-term fee-based revenue stream for the partnership.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners, Williams Analyst Day Set for May 11 \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams are scheduled to host their 2017 Analyst \n      Day event May 11.

A link to the webcast, as well \n      as replays of the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days \n      following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its first-quarter 2017 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners \n      websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The time to build this \n      project is now.\u201d\n     \n     \n      After receiving a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from \n      the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in February 2017, \n      Atlantic Sunrise can begin delivering benefits to Pennsylvania once the \n      last remaining state permits necessary to begin construction are \n      secured. Construction on the Central Penn Line (the greenfield portion \n      of the project) is targeted to begin in the 3rd Quarter of 2017, which \n      would allow the full project capacity to be placed into service in \n      mid-2018.\n     \n     \n      \u201cPennsylvania is poised, perhaps unlike at any other time in recent \n      memory, to benefit in every way \u2014 new jobs, better wages, reduced energy \n      costs, increased tax revenue and economic prosperity for generations to \n      come,\u201d said\u00a0Pennsylvania Chemical Industry Council President Jeff \n      Logan.\u00a0\u201cAfter nearly three years of intense regulatory scrutiny, it is \n      time for our own state government to complete its review of this \n      important infrastructure project so that Pennsylvanians can immediately \n      benefit from the economic growth and jobs it promises to deliver. This \n      includes the chemical industry which supports more than 90,000 direct \n      and related jobs in the Commonwealth.\u201d\n     \n     \n      In 2015 Pennsylvania State University researchers forecast the Atlantic \n      Sunrise project to directly and indirectly support approximately 8,000 \n      jobs in the 10 Pennsylvania counties during the project\u2019s construction \n      phase, resulting in an estimated $1.6 billion economic impact in the \n      project area.\n     \n     \n      \u201cGrowth in the energy industry can create steady, reliable careers for \n      millions of men and women in our country and in this state,\u201d said Dave \n      Horn, LECET Representative, Mid-Atlantic LIUNA. \u201cMore specifically, \n      pipeline work is a life line for good union jobs with family-supporting \n      pay resulting in millions of dollars being reinvested back into the \n      community and local businesses. We work on these projects; we have seen \n      first-hand the economic benefits.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Recently, a petition signed by more than 3,000 supporters was delivered \n      to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf requesting swift state regulatory \n      approval of the project.

The favorable change was driven by a $254 million \n      increase in investing income, primarily associated with a transaction \n      involving certain joint-venture interests as well as a $171 million \n      improvement in operating income and the absence of $112 million of \n      impairments of equity-method investments in 2016. These favorable \n      changes were partially offset by an increase in income attributable to \n      noncontrolling interests primarily associated with increased income at \n      WPZ and a $35 million increase in the provision for income taxes, driven \n      by higher pre-tax income partially offset by a $127 million benefit from \n      the expected utilization of a capital loss carryover.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported first-quarter 2017 Cash Flow from Operations (CFFO) of \n      $606 million, a $177 million decrease from first-quarter 2016. The \n      decrease from the prior year is driven by the absence of $198 million of \n      cash received in 2016 associated with minimum volume commitments, which \n      were replaced by contract restructurings that occurred in the latter \n      part of 2016. The prior year also included $80 million of cash received \n      as a milestone payment associated with Transco\u2019s Hillabee expansion \n      project. These unfavorable changes in CFFO were partially offset by \n      improved operating results.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported first-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.145 billion, \n      an $89 million increase over first-quarter 2016. The favorable change \n      was driven primarily by a $57 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from \n      the Williams Partners segment and a $32 million increase in Williams\u2019 \n      Other segment which benefitted from $24 million of higher income \n      associated with a regulatory asset primarily driven by our increased \n      ownership in WPZ.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the \n      following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to differentiate ourselves with a focused strategy on \n      natural gas infrastructure in support of consistent and sustainable \n      growth in gas volumes. We continue to deliver top quartile EBITDA growth \n      among our peers as we increased year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA for the \n      14th quarter in a row. This quarter, our growth was delivered despite \n      some significant impacts from third-party outages and more extreme \n      weather in the Rockies area, proving once again the resiliency of our \n      business model.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur project teams continued to deliver as we brought on the 1.2 Bcf/D \n      Gulf Trace project ahead of schedule and under budget. That is just one \n      of five Transco pipeline system expansions that we expect to place in \n      service in 2017. Our successful 2016 work to bring the Gunflint and \n      Kodiak tiebacks in service was showcased this quarter by Atlantic-Gulf\u2019s \n      higher volumes and higher fee-based revenues. And our backlog of \n      projects continues to grow as we had a very successful Southeastern \n      Trail open season in the quarter as well.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe continue to strengthen our foundation for long-term, sustainable \n      growth in our core business, as highlighted by the recently announced \n      agreement to sell our interests in the Geismar olefins facility while \n      gaining a new third party fee-based revenue stream for our Bayou Ethane \n      system. With the expected sale of Geismar, and the sale of our Canadian \n      business in late 2016, we\u2019ll realize around 97 percent of our gross \n      margins coming from predictable, fee-based sources.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur consolidation of operating areas from five to three became \n      effective in first-quarter 2017 \u2013 not only streamlining our \n      organization, but helping us continue the cost-savings momentum we began \n      in the second quarter of last year. We expect to realize further cost \n      savings through the consolidation of offices and systems.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners and Other. In September 2016, Williams announced organizational \n      changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational \n      alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive \n      continued focus on customer service and execution. Effective, Jan. 1, \n      2017, Williams implemented these changes which combined the management \n      of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating \n      areas managed within our business. As a result of this realignment and \n      the sale of our Canadian operations, the Williams NGL & Petchem Services \n      reporting segment has been eliminated and the remaining assets are \n      reported with Other.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Williams \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Modified and Adjusted EBITDA \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           1Q 2017 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           1Q 2016 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n             Modified \n \n EBITDA \n           \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Adjust. \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           \n             Adjusted \n \n EBITDA \n           \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n             Modified \n \n EBITDA \n           \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Adjust. \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           \n             Adjusted \n \n EBITDA \n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Williams Partners\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1,132\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          ($15)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1,117\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $955\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $105\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $1,060\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Other\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          18\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          10\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          28\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          (37)\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          33\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          (4)\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Total\n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $1,150 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           ($5) \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           $1,145 \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $918 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           $138 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           $1,056 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Definitions of modified EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and schedules \n          reconciling to net income are included in this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Comprised of our consolidated master limited partnership, WPZ, Williams \n      Partners segment includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. The gas \n      pipeline business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline \n      joint project investments. The midstream business provides natural gas \n      gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL \n      production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; \n      deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; an \n      olefin production business, and is comprised of several wholly owned and \n      partially owned subsidiaries and joint project investments.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of $1.132 \n      billion, an increase of $177 million from first-quarter 2016. Adjusted \n      EBITDA increased $57 million to $1.117 billion. The favorable change in \n      Modified EBITDA was due primarily to contributions from expansion \n      projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Transco, as well as higher commodity \n      margins and lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general \n      and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The favorable change also included a \n      net $30 million gain on the early retirement of debt. The increase in \n      Adjusted EBITDA is driven primarily by $37 million higher commodity \n      margins and $30 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses. Partially \n      offsetting these improvements were $30 million lower fee-based revenues \n      driven by lower volumes and prices associated with restructured \n      contracts, partially offset by contributions from expansion projects in \n      the Gulf of Mexico.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for first-quarter 2017 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 Other segment reported first-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of \n      $18 million, an increase of $55 million from first-quarter 2016. \n      Adjusted EBITDA realized a $32 million improvement to $28 million. The \n      favorable changes in both measures benefited from $24 million of higher \n      income associated with a regulatory asset primarily driven by our \n      increased ownership in WPZ.\n     \n     \n       Notable Recent Events \n     \n     \n      On March 30, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it had completed \n      separate transactions with Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) \n      (\u201cWestern Gas\u201d), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) \n      (\u201cAnadarko\u201d), and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) (\u201cEnergy \n      Transfer\u201d), and certain of their respective affiliates, for an aggregate \n      cash consideration of $200 million paid to Williams Partners and an \n      increase in Williams Partners\u2019 ownership in two Marcellus shale \n      gathering systems, in exchange for Williams Partners\u2019 assignment of \n      interests in certain non-operated Delaware Basin assets.\n     \n     \n      On April 17, 2017, Williams Partners announced that it has agreed to \n      sell 100 percent of its membership interest in Williams Olefins LLC, \n      which owns an 88.46 percent undivided ownership interest in the Geismar, \n      Louisiana, olefins plant and associated complex, to NOVA Chemicals for \n      $2.1 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in summer \n      2017. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory \n      approvals. Additionally, upon closing of the transaction, Williams \n      Partners subsidiaries will enter into long-term supply and \n      transportation agreements with NOVA Chemicals to provide feedstock to \n      the Geismar olefins plant via Williams Partners\u2019 ethane pipeline system \n      in the U.S. Gulf Coast. These agreements will secure a meaningful \n      long-term fee-based revenue stream for Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Williams\u2019 Reduction of Debt Update \n     \n     \n      Through first-quarter 2017, Williams has reduced its debt by $1.623 \n      billion. As previously announced on Jan. 9, 2017, in conjunction with \n      its financial repositioning plan, Williams expects to have excess cash \n      available to reduce debt throughout 2017 after paying its dividend and \n      other cash requirements.\u00a0As a result, we expect to reduce Williams\u2019 \n      parent-company debt by approximately $500 million for full-year 2017.\n     \n     \n       Williams, Williams Partners Analyst Day Set for May 11 \n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners are scheduled to host their 2017 Analyst \n      Day event May 11.

A limited number of phone lines will \n      be available at (877) 741-4253. International callers should dial (719) \n      325-4783. The conference ID is 2089672. A link to the webcast, as well \n      as replays of the webcast, will be available for at least 90 days \n      following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its first-quarter 2017 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. Once filed, the \n      document will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash \n      available for dividends and other uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend \n      coverage ratio, and economic coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP \n      financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management \n      believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into \n      results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, \n      less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available \n      for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative \n      to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to \n      include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow in \n      excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the \n      period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash \n      flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as \n      substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with \n      United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The favorable change was \n      driven by the absence of a $1.1 billion impairment of goodwill and $580 \n      million of lower impairments of equity-method investments. The \n      improvement also reflected lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and \n      selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income \n      attributable to controlling interests of $431 million, a $1.880 billion \n      improvement compared to full-year 2015 results. The favorable change was \n      driven by the absence of a $1.1 billion impairment of goodwill and $929 \n      million of lower impairments of equity-method investments. The \n      improvements also reflected an increase in olefins margins associated \n      with the Geismar olefins plant, higher fee-based revenues, lower O&M and \n      SG&A expenses and higher equity earnings. These favorable changes were \n      partially offset by increased asset-impairment charges, a loss \n      associated with the sale of our Canadian operations, a reduction of $119 \n      million of insurance recoveries and higher interest expenses.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported fourth-quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.113 \n      billion, a $49 million increase over fourth-quarter 2015. The increase \n      was due primarily to $48 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $17 \n      million higher commodity margins. These increases were partially offset \n      by $23 million due to a one-time, year-to-date true-up of amounts \n      previously recognized during 2016 related to Barnett Shale minimum \n      volume commitments caused by the Barnett re-contracting that occurred \n      during the fourth quarter.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $4.427 \n      billion, a $338 million increase over full-year 2015 results. The \n      increase is due primarily to $130 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses, \n      $111 million higher olefins margins due primarily to a full year of \n      Geismar operations, $93 million higher fee-based revenues primarily due \n      to expansion projects and $47 million of higher proportional EBITDA from \n      joint ventures. These favorable changes were partially offset by $43 \n      million of other unfavorable changes including a $20 million unfavorable \n      change in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our \n      former Canadian operations.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For fourth-quarter 2016, Williams Partners generated $699 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $718 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for the same period last year. The decrease is due primarily to a $33 \n      million increase in maintenance capital and a $25 million increase in \n      interest expense, partially offset by the previously described \n      improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. For fourth-quarter 2016, the cash \n      distribution coverage ratio was 0.92x.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the partnership generated $2.970 billion in DCF, an \n      increase of $151 million over full-year 2015 DCF results. The increase \n      was due primarily to the $338 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA \n      described above, partially offset by $125 million higher interest \n      expense and $39 million higher maintenance capital. For full-year 2016, \n      the cash distribution coverage ratio was 1.01x.\n     \n     \n      On Feb. 10, 2017, Williams Partners paid a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders of record at \n      the close of business on Feb. 3, 2017.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe realized strong cash flows from operations in 2016. The fact that \n      Williams Partners delivered 8 percent year-over-year growth in Adjusted \n      EBITDA demonstrates the strength of our proven natural gas-focused \n      strategy. Our well-positioned natural gas infrastructure assets enabled \n      us to once again organically grow fee-based revenues while our \n      disciplined approach drove lower expenses even as we brought new assets \n      online.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe demand for natural gas for clean-power generation, heating, \n      industrial use and LNG continues to increase as highlighted last month \n      when Transco established record high one-day and three-day delivery \n      volumes. We have construction underway on a number of Transco-expansion \n      projects. And just this month, we successfully placed into service our \n      Gulf Trace project, a 1.2 million dekatherm per day expansion of the \n      Transco pipeline system to serve Cheniere Energy\u2019s Sabine Pass \n      Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana. Gulf Trace is just one of the \n      five Transco projects that are planned to be completed this year. This \n      project was also brought in under budget and nearly six months ahead of \n      its original planned in-service date.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn January, we took steps to strengthen our financial position and \n      lower our cost of capital to match up with our peer-leading, \n      high-quality, low-risk growth portfolio. We continue to fortify our \n      focus on natural gas market fundamentals. Once the Geismar monetization \n      process is completed, we expect to be at approximately 97 percent \n      fee-based revenues driven by natural gas volumes. As a result, Williams \n      and Williams Partners are positioned for long-term, sustainable growth.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     View Full Table  \n       \n

reconciling these measures to net income are included in this news \n          release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      For the fourth-quarter and full-year 2016, the Atlantic-Gulf operating \n      area included the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a 41 percent \n      interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline development \n      project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment also included \n      the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and processing and \n      crude oil production handling and transportation in the Gulf Coast \n      region. These operations include a 51 percent consolidated interest in \n      Gulfstar One, a 50 percent equity method interest in Gulfstream and a 60 \n      percent equity-method interest in the Discovery pipeline and processing \n      system.\n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $451 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2016, compared with $385 million for fourth-quarter 2015. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $59 million to $449 million for the same \n      time period. The increase in both measures was due primarily to $47 \n      million higher fee-based revenues primarily from offshore projects and \n      Transco expansion projects as well as $9 million of higher NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $1.600 billion, \n      an increase of $77 million over full-year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA \n      increased $112 million to $1.640 billion. The increase in Modified \n      EBITDA was due primarily to $74 million higher fee-based revenues \n      predominantly from Transco expansion projects and offshore expansions as \n      well as $30 million higher proportional EBITDA from Discovery. Partially \n      offsetting these increases were higher expenses primarily related to the \n      net impact of new assets being placed into service and increased \n      maintenance and modernization expenses. Modified EBITDA was also \n      unfavorably impacted by potential rate refunds associated with \n      litigation, severance-related costs, and project development costs, all \n      of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       Central \n     \n     \n      For the fourth-quarter and full-year 2016, the Central operating area \n      included operations that were previously part of the former Access \n      Midstream segment located in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. \n      These operations became the Central operating area effective Jan. 1, \n      2016 and prior-period segment disclosures have been recast for this \n      change. In 2016, Central provided gathering, treating and compression \n      services to producers under long-term, fee-based contracts. The segment \n      also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the Delaware Basin \n      gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region.\n     \n     \n      The Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $340 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2016, a decrease of $44 million from fourth-quarter 2015. \n      Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $25 million to $194 million. The \n      unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to a $27 million \n      reduction in fee-based revenues, which decreased primarily due to volume \n      declines in the Barnett and Anadarko as well as a lower rate in the \n      Barnett, Anadarko, and Eagle Ford areas. These decreases were partially \n      offset by higher rates and volumes in the Haynesville Basin primarily \n      attributable to the restructured contract with Chesapeake. Modified \n      EBITDA was also favorably impacted by a $16 million decrease in O&M and \n      SG&A expenses from fourth-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably \n      impacted by approximately $23 million due to a one-time, year-to-date \n      true-up of amounts previously recognized during 2016 related to Barnett \n      Shale minimum volume commitments caused by the Barnett re-contracting \n      that occurred during the fourth quarter.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $807 million, a decrease of $33 million from full-year 2015 results. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million to $912 million. The decrease in \n      Modified EBITDA was due primarily to lower fee-based revenues and higher \n      non-cash asset impairment charges. Consistent with the fourth-quarter \n      explanation, fee revenues decreased primarily due to volume declines in \n      the Barnett and Anadarko as well as a lower rate in the Barnett, \n      Anadarko, and Eagle Ford areas. These decreases were partially offset by \n      higher rates and volumes in the Haynesville primarily attributable to \n      the restructured contract with Chesapeake. Full-year 2016 Modified \n      EBITDA was also favorably impacted by lower O&M and SG&A expenses due to \n      cost-reduction efforts and the absence of prior-year merger and \n      transition costs as well as higher proportional EBITDA from \n      joint-venture operations. Adjusted EBITDA was not impacted by the \n      impairment charges or merger and transition costs.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      In 2016, NGL & Petchem Services operating area included an 88.5 percent \n      undivided ownership interest in an olefins production facility in \n      Geismar, Louisiana, along with a refinery grade propylene splitter and \n      pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment also included the \n      partnership\u2019s energy commodities marketing business, an NGL fractionator \n      and storage facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50 percent equity-method \n      interest in Overland Pass Pipeline. Prior to the sale of all of our \n      Canadian-based assets effective Sept. 23, 2016, this segment included \n      midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil sands offgas \n      processing plant near Fort McMurray, 261 miles of NGL and olefins \n      pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility at Redwater.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $81 \n      million for fourth-quarter 2016, compared with $72 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $15 million to $87 \n      million. The increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $7 million \n      lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $6 million higher commodity margins. \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $8 million lower fee-based \n      revenues.\n     \n     \n      For the year, NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified \n      EBITDA of ($23) million compared with $321 million during full-year \n      2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $163 million to $360 million. The \n      decrease in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to a second-quarter 2016 \n      non-cash impairment charge of $341 million associated with our former \n      Canadian operations, the additional loss associated with the sale, and \n      $119 million of lower business-interruption proceeds. Partially \n      offsetting these unfavorable items were $111 million favorable olefins \n      margins, primarily related to higher volumes and prices at the Geismar \n      olefins plant, and a $30 million increase in fee-based revenues \n      primarily from our former Canadian operations. Adjusted EBITDA excludes \n      the impairment charge, additional loss-on-sale and insurance proceeds.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P operating area includes the Susquehanna Supply Hub, Ohio \n      Valley Midstream, Marcellus South, Bradford and Utica midstream \n      gathering and processing operations as well as its 69-percent equity \n      investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its 58.4 percent equity \n      investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II owns a 50 percent \n      interest in Blue Racer Midstream. The Marcellus South, Bradford and \n      Utica midstream gathering and processing operations that were previously \n      within the former Access Midstream segment became part of Northeast G&P \n      effective Jan. 1, 2016 and prior period segment disclosures have been \n      recast for this change.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $202 million \n      for fourth-quarter 2016, compared with $196 million for fourth-quarter \n      2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million to $212 million. The increase \n      in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $15 million lower O&M and SG&A \n      expenses and $12 million higher fee-based revenues. Partially offsetting \n      the increases was $18 million lower proportional joint-venture EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $840 million compared with $753 million for full-year 2015. Adjusted \n      EBITDA increased $43 million to $861 million. The increase in Modified \n      EBITDA was driven by $37 million higher fee-based revenues, $36 million \n      reduced O&M expenses, and a reduced level of non-cash impairment \n      charges. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of non-cash impairment \n      charges.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      In 2016, the West operating area included the partnership\u2019s Northwest \n      Pipeline interstate gas pipeline system, as well as gathering, \n      processing and treating operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and \n      the Four Corners area.\n     \n     \n      West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $170 million for \n      fourth-quarter 2016, compared with $77 million for fourth-quarter 2015. \n      Adjusted EBITDA of $171 million is $4 million lower than the same period \n      in 2015. The increase in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the \n      absence of $97 million non-cash impairment charges incurred in 2015. The \n      favorable change in Modified EBITDA was also driven by $7 million lower \n      O&M and SG&A expenses, $4 million higher commodity margins, and $11 \n      million lower fee-based revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the \n      prior-year non-cash impairment charges.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $649 \n      million compared with $557 million for full-year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA \n      increased $6 million to $654 million. The increase in Modified EBITDA \n      was driven primarily by the absence of $97 million non-cash impairment \n      charges incurred in 2015. The favorable change in Modified EBITDA was \n      also driven by $26 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $17 million \n      lower fee-based revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the prior-year \n      non-cash impairment charges.\n     \n     \n       Financial Repositioning and Guidance \n     \n     \n      On Jan. 9, 2017, Williams Partners and Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced a \n      financial repositioning plan designed to strengthen Williams Partners\u2019 \n      distribution coverage, enhance the partnership\u2019s credit profile, improve \n      cost of capital, remove the partnership\u2019s need to access public equity \n      markets for the next several years and boost its growth outlook. The \n      plan included the permanent waiver of Incentive Distribution Rights \n      (IDRs) held by Williams in exchange for 289 million newly issued \n      Williams Partners\u2019 common units which closed on Jan. 9.\n     \n     \n      Also as part of this plan, Williams purchased 58.7 million newly issued \n      Williams Partners common units with total proceeds of $2.1 \n      billion.\u00a0Williams Partners used $600 million of these proceeds to repay \n      7.25 percent notes that matured on Feb. 1, 2017 and also announced that \n      on Feb. 23, 2017 it will redeem all of its $750 million 6.125 percent \n      senior notes due 2022.\u00a0We expect the balance of the proceeds to be used \n      to fund capital and investment expenditures.\u00a0Also as previously \n      announced, Williams expects to raise more than $2 billion in after-tax \n      proceeds from planned asset monetizations of Geismar and other select \n      assets which are not core to our strategy.\u00a0We expect proceeds from these \n      monetizations will be used for additional debt reduction and to fund \n      capital and investment expenditures.\n     \n     \n      Additionally, the partnership announced its intent to pay a regular \n      quarterly cash distribution of $0.60 per common unit beginning with the \n      next quarterly distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2017. The \n      partnership expects to pay $2.40 per common unit for 2017 and is \n      targeting 5 to 7 percent annual growth over the next several years.\n     \n     \n      Guidance for 2017 (as previously announced on Jan. 9, 2017) is unchanged.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners\u2019 Year-End 2016 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A \n      Webcast Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 financial results \n      package will be posted shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The materials will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on \n      Thursday, Feb. 16 at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines will \n      be available at (800) 946-0709. International callers should dial (719) \n      325-2376. The conference ID is 7387877. A link to the webcast, as well \n      as replays of the webcast, will be available for two weeks following the \n      event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-K \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its 2016 Form 10-K with the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be \n      available on both the SEC and Williams Partners\u2019 websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to non-controlling interests and cash income taxes, plus \n      WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain \n      other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance.

The \n      favorable change was partially offset by an increase of $664 million in \n      pre-tax impairments of certain assets, primarily associated with our \n      disposed Canadian assets, $119 million of lower insurance recoveries, \n      and an unfavorable change in net income attributable to non-controlling \n      interests driven primarily by higher WPZ income and reduced incentive \n      distributions from WPZ associated with the termination of the WPZ Merger \n      Agreement.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported fourth-quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.123 billion, \n      a $57 million increase over fourth-quarter 2015. The favorable change \n      was due primarily to a $49 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from the \n      Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $4.436 billion, an \n      increase of $332 million compared to full-year 2015 results. The \n      increase was due primarily to a $338 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA \n      from the Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe realized strong cash flows from operations in 2016. The fact that \n      Williams delivered 8 percent year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA \n      demonstrates the strength of our proven natural gas-focused strategy. \n      Our well-positioned natural gas infrastructure assets enabled us to once \n      again organically grow fee-based revenues while our disciplined approach \n      drove lower expenses even as we brought new assets online.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe demand for natural gas for clean-power generation, heating, \n      industrial use and LNG continues to increase as highlighted last month \n      when Transco established record high one-day and three-day delivery \n      volumes. We have construction underway on a number of Transco-expansion \n      projects. And just this month, we successfully placed into service our \n      Gulf Trace project, a 1.2 million dekatherm per day expansion of the \n      Transco pipeline system to serve Cheniere Energy\u2019s Sabine Pass \n      Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana. Gulf Trace is just one of the \n      five Transco projects that are planned to be completed this year. This \n      project was also brought in under budget and nearly six months ahead of \n      its original planned in-service date.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn January, we took steps to strengthen our financial position and \n      lower our cost of capital to match up with our peer-leading, \n      high-quality, low-risk growth portfolio. We continue to fortify our \n      focus on natural gas market fundamentals. Once the Geismar monetization \n      process is completed, we expect to be at approximately 97 percent \n      fee-based revenues driven by natural gas volumes. As a result, Williams \n      and Williams Partners are positioned for long-term, sustainable growth.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      For fourth-quarter and

Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported fourth-quarter 2016 Modified EBITDA of $1.235 \n      billion, an increase of $123 million from fourth-quarter 2015. Adjusted \n      EBITDA increased $49 million to $1.113 billion. The favorable change in \n      Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $34 million lower O&M and SG&A \n      expenses, $17 million higher commodity margins, and a $62 million \n      decrease in asset-impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA generally excludes \n      the impairment charges, and was also unfavorably impacted by \n      approximately $23 million due to a one-time, year-to-date true-up of \n      amounts previously recognized during 2016 related to Barnett Shale \n      minimum volume commitments caused by the Barnett re-contracting that \n      occurred during the fourth quarter.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $3.864 \n      billion, a decrease of $139 million compared to results for full-year \n      2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $338 million to $4.427 billion. The \n      decrease in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by a non-cash \n      impairment charge of $341 million associated with the sale of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 former Canadian operations, and $119 million of lower business \n      interruption proceeds. Partially offsetting these unfavorable changes \n      were $134 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses, $111 million higher \n      olefins margins, and $78 million higher fee-based revenues. Adjusted \n      EBITDA excludes the impairment charges described above.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for fourth-quarter and \n      full-year 2016 are provided in the earnings news release issued today by \n      Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Williams NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      In fourth-quarter and full-year 2016, this segment included petchem \n      pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. Prior to the sale of all of our \n      Canadian-based assets effective Sept. 23, 2016, this segment included an \n      offgas processing plant in Canada at CNRL\u2019s Horizon upgrader that went \n      into service in first-quarter 2016. The segment also included a propane \n      dehydrogenation facility growth project under development in Canada.\n     \n     \n      Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported Modified EBITDA of ($11) \n      million for fourth-quarter 2016, compared with ($70) million for \n      fourth-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA improved $2 million to ($4) \n      million. The improvement in Modified EBITDA was driven by the absence of \n      a $64 million write-off in 2015 of previously capitalized project \n      development costs for an olefins pipeline project.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported Modified EBITDA \n      of ($540) million, a decrease of $457 million when compared to results \n      for full-year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $24 million to ($43) \n      million primarily related to our now former Canadian operations. The \n      decrease in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to a $406 million \n      impairment of our now former Canadian operations, a $32 million \n      additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of our now \n      former Canadian operations, $61 million of Canadian project development \n      costs and the absence of a $64 million write-off of previously \n      capitalized project development costs for an olefins pipeline project \u2013 \n      all of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       Financial Repositioning and Guidance \n     \n     \n      On Jan. 9, 2017, Williams and Williams Partners announced a financial \n      repositioning plan designed to enhance Williams\u2019 and Williams Partners\u2019 \n      credit profile, improve Williams Partners\u2019 cost of capital, eliminate \n      Williams Partners\u2019 need to access public equity markets for the next \n      several years and boost their growth outlook. The plan included the \n      permanent waiver of Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs) held by \n      Williams in exchange for 289 million newly issued Williams Partners\u2019 \n      common units, which closed on Jan. 9.\n     \n     \n      Additionally, Williams issued 74.75 million new shares to fund the \n      purchase of 58.7 million newly issued Williams Partners common units for \n      total consideration of $2.1 billion.\u00a0Williams Partners then used $600 \n      million of these proceeds to repay 7.25 percent notes that matured on \n      Feb. 1, 2017 and also announced that on Feb. 23, 2017, it will redeem \n      all of its $750 million 6.125 percent senior notes due 2022. We expect \n      Williams Partners will use the balance of the proceeds to fund capital \n      and investment expenditures.\u00a0Also as previously announced, Williams \n      expects to raise more than $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from planned \n      asset monetizations of Geismar and other select assets that are not core \n      to our strategy.\u00a0We expect Williams Partners will use the proceeds from \n      these monetizations for additional debt reduction and to fund capital \n      and investment expenditures.\n     \n     \n      As previously announced, Williams expects to have excess cash available \n      to reduce debt throughout 2017 after paying its dividend and other cash \n      requirements.\u00a0As a result, we expect to reduce Williams\u2019 parent-company \n      debt by approximately $500 million for full-year 2017. Williams expects \n      a dividend coverage ratio of 1.3x in 2017 or approximately 1.7x when \n      adjusted to include Williams\u2019 74 percent economic interest in Williams \n      Partners\u2019 excess coverage.\n     \n     \n      Also as part of this plan, the company announced its intent to increase \n      its regular quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share effective with the \n      quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2017 \u2013 a 50 percent increase from \n      $0.20 per share paid in December 2016. Williams expects to pay $1.20 per \n      share for 2017 and is targeting 10 to 15 percent annual growth for the \n      next several years.\n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 and Williams Partners\u2019 Guidance for 2017 (as previously \n      announced on Jan. 9) is unchanged.\n     \n     \n       Williams\u2019 Year-End 2016 Materials to Be Posted Shortly; Q&A Webcast \n      Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 financial results package \n      will be posted shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The materials will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners will host a joint Q&A live webcast on \n      Thursday, Feb. 16 at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines will \n      be available at (800) 946-0709. International callers should dial (719) \n      325-2376. The conference ID is 7387877. A link to the webcast, as well \n      as replays of the webcast, will be available for two weeks following the \n      event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-K \n     \n     \n      The company   plans to file its 2016 Form 10-K with the Securities \n      and Exchange Commission (SEC) next week. Once filed, the document will \n      be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 Adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash \n      available for dividends and other uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend \n      coverage ratio, and economic coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP \n      financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received \n      from our ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by the Williams NGL & \n      Petchem Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends \n      relative to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics \n      to include Williams\u2019 proportional share of WPZ\u2019s distributable cash flow \n      in excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic \n      coverage ratio.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the \n      period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash \n      flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as \n      substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with \n      United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

(2) As previously announced, effective with the third quarter of 2016, Williams reduced its regular quarterly dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.20 per share. The dividend reduction supports Williams' plan to reinvest a portion of the cash available for dividends and other uses into Williams Partners. \u00a0 Third-Quarter 2016 Financial Results Williams reported third-quarter 2016 unaudited net income of $61 million, a $101 million increase from third-quarter 2015 net income. The favorable change was driven by the absence of $461 million of impairments of equity-method investments recognized in 2015.\u00a0The improvement also reflected higher olefins margins at our Geismar plant, lower operating and maintenance expenses, and higher service revenues associated with expansion projects, partially offset by a $65 million additional loss upon completing the sale of our Canadian operations, higher interest expense, and expensed project development costs. Year-to-date Williams reported an unaudited net loss of ($409) million, a $553 million decrease from the same time period in 2015. The unfavorable change was driven by increased impairment charges and the additional loss on sale associated with our Canadian operations, the absence of $126 million of insurance recoveries, expensed project development costs and higher interest incurred. The decrease also includes an unfavorable change in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests driven primarily by the impact of reduced incentive distributions from WPZ associated with the termination of the WPZ Merger Agreement as well as higher WPZ income. These declines were partially offset by the favorable impact of lower impairments of equity-method investments, an increase in olefins margins associated with our Geismar plant, decreases in operating and maintenance expenses, and higher equity earnings. Williams reported third-quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.192 billion, an $89 million increase over third-quarter 2015. The improvement is due primarily to an $89 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from the Williams Partners segment and an $8 million increase in the Other segment, partially offset by an $8 million decrease for the Williams NGL & Petchem segment. Year-to-date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.313 billion, an increase of $275 million over the same period in 2015. The improvement is due primarily to a $289 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from the Williams Partners segment and a $12 million increase in the Other segment, partially offset by a $26 million decrease at the Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment. During third-quarter 2016, Williams reported Cash Available for Dividends and Other Uses of $441 million and received $220 million for its share of proceeds related to the sale of its Canadian assets. During third-quarter 2016, Williams reduced borrowing on its credit facility by $265 million, reinvested $250 million via a private placement to purchase WPZ common units pursuant to its previously announced plans, and paid a cash dividend to shareholders totaling $150 million. CEO Perspective Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the following comments: \u201cWith Adjusted EBITDA growth across all five of the partnership\u2019s operating areas and increased distributable cash flow achieved by Williams Partners, our strong third-quarter results highlighted once again the effectiveness of our strategy and how well-positioned we are to capture natural gas demand growth now and in the future. \u201cOur recent accomplishments reflect disciplined execution against our business plan. The new Kodiak, Gunflint and Rock Springs facilities all contributed to our growth in the third quarter. Despite the expanding number of major projects recently placed in-service, we reduced expenses on a year-to-date basis. We also completed win-win contract renegotiations with our customer Chesapeake and completed the sale of our Canadian businesses as we continue to take decisive actions to position our company for predictable growth. \u201cOur future growth is also visible in the number of projects now under construction. After receiving the necessary permits to begin construction, we began work in the third quarter on Dalton, Virginia Southside II and Phase 1 of Hillabee. Construction on our New York Bay Expansion project began this month while construction also continues on our Gulf Trace project. We are aiming to place all of these Transco-expansion projects into service next year. \u201cWe are also excited to have the additional expertise and contributions of five new, independent energy-industry veterans on the Williams Board of Directors.\u201d Business Segment Results Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and Other. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Williams \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3Q 2016 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3Q 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 YTD 2016 \u00a0 YTD 2015 Amounts in millions \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified EBITDA Adjust.

Williams Partners reported third-quarter 2016 Modified EBITDA of $1.07 billion, an increase of $49 million from third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $89 million to $1.189 billion. The increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $33 million higher olefins margins, $32 million higher fee-based revenues and $21 million lower operating and maintenance and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The 2016 period also included a $32 million additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of our Canadian operations and expensed project development costs, both of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $2.629 billion, a decrease of $262 million over the same period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $289 million to $3.314 billion. The decrease in Modified EBITDA occurred primarily due to a $341 million impairment charge associated with the partnership\u2019s held-for-sale Canadian operations, the absence in 2016 of $126 million in business interruption proceeds from the 2013 Geismar Olefins plant incident that were recorded in second-quarter 2015 and a $48 million impairment charge related to a gathering system. These were partially offset by higher olefins margins reflecting a full nine months of production at the Geismar Olefins plant, $101 million lower operating and maintenance and selling, general, and administrative expenses, $70 million higher joint-venture EBITDA primarily from Discovery and $65 million higher fee-based revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impairment charges and insurance proceeds described above. Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for third-quarter 2016 are provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners. Williams NGL & Petchem Services This segment currently includes petchem pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. Prior to the sale of all of our Canadian-based assets effective Sept. 23, 2016, this segment also included an offgas processing plant in Canada at CNRL\u2019s Horizon upgrader that went into service in first-quarter 2016. The segment also included a propane dehydrogenation facility growth project under development in Canada. Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported third-quarter 2016 Modified EBITDA of ($62) million, a decrease of $57 million from third quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $8 million to ($13) million. The decrease in Modified EBITDA is due primarily to a $33 million additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of our Canadian operations and $16 million of Canadian project-development costs, both of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported Modified EBITDA of ($529) million, a decrease of $516 million over the same time period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $26 million to ($39) million. The decrease in Modified EBITDA is due primarily to a $406 million impairment of our Canadian operations, a $33 million additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of our Canadian operations and $61 million of Canadian project-development costs all of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Partners Provides Revised 2017 Growth Capital Guidance Related Primarily to Atlantic Sunrise Project Timing Williams Partners is revising its 2017 growth capital\u00a0guidance amounts due primarily to the shift in Transco and related Northeast G&P growth spending caused by the revised Atlantic Sunrise in-service date, as well as new projects and other changes. As discussed in its press release dated Oct. 28, 2016, Williams Partners expects partial Atlantic Sunrise service to begin during the second half of 2017 and is now targeting full in-service during mid-2018. Consistent with prior financial practice, Williams Partners\u2019 financial plan further risks these project cash flows by approximately six months. The following guidance range represents both the targeted in-service date and the further risked in-service date: total 2017 growth capital and investment expenditures are expected to be between $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion, including total 2017 growth capital for Transco, which is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion. Third-Quarter 2016 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A Webcast Scheduled for This Morning Williams\u2019 third-quarter 2016 financial results package will be posted shortly at  www.williams.com . The package will include the data book and analyst package. Williams and Williams Partners plan to jointly host a Q&A live webcast today, (Oct. 31), at 9:30 a.m. EDT. A limited number of phone lines will be available at (888) 364-3105. International callers should dial (719) 325-2228. The conference ID is 6961753. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast, will be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com . Form 10-Q The company plans to file its third-quarter 2016 Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document will be available on both the SEC and Williams\u2019 websites. Non-GAAP Measures This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends, and dividend coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method investments. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations. Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received from our ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by the Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative to actual cash dividends paid. This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles."},

Construction on the \n      Central Penn Line, the greenfield portion of the project, is targeted to \n      begin early in the 3rd Quarter of 2017, which would allow the full \n      project capacity to be placed into service in mid-2018.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWilliams' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline project is a nearly $3 billion \n      investment that will encourage continued production of natural gas in \n      the shale regions and investment in manufacturing throughout \n      Pennsylvania.\u00a0Infrastructure like this is needed to strengthen our \n      energy portfolio, which also includes coal, nuclear and renewables.

The Garden State, \n      Dalton, Hillabee (Phase 1), Virginia Southside II and New York Bay \n      Expansion projects are all under construction and/or expected to be \n      placed in-service this year.\n     \n     \n      Transco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Partners, of which \n      Williams (NYSE: WMB) owns controlling interests. Transco is the nation\u2019s \n      largest and fastest-growing interstate natural gas transmission pipeline \n      system. It delivers natural gas to customers through its 10,200-mile \n      pipeline network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles between South \n      Texas and New York City. The system provides cost-effective natural gas \n      services to U.S. markets in the Southeast and Atlantic seaboard states, \n      including major metropolitan areas in New York, New Jersey and \n      Pennsylvania, as well as international markets.\n     \n     \n      "},

These actions will deliver immediate and ongoing benefits and \n      position Williams and Williams Partners for long-term, sustainable \n      growth. The improvement of Williams Partners\u2019 cost of capital and \n      simplified organizational structure will better align GP and LP \n      interests as well as solidify Williams Partners\u2019 investment-grade credit \n      ratings.

Williams Partners expects distribution growth of 5-7% annually \n      over the next several years. Future quarterly distributions are subject \n      to quarterly approval by Williams Partners\u2019 board of directors.\n     \n     \n      Williams announced that effective with the quarterly dividend to be paid \n      in March 2017, Williams expects to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per \n      share ($1.20 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 50% above \n      Williams\u2019 dividend paid in December 2016 of $0.20 per share ($0.80 per \n      share on an annualized basis).

In addition, the Transactions result \n      in debt reduction at Williams Partners and a meaningful increase in its \n      cash coverage ratio to approximately 1.2x in 2017 and maintenance of \n      strong coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter.\n     \n     \n      Dividend coverage ratio at Williams will be approximately 1.3x in 2017, \n      with continued coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter.

As always, the Board \n      remains open to considering any potential strategic alternative that \n      would maximize value for stockholders.\n     \n     \n      Williams notes that, as a matter of practice, it does not comment on \n      market rumors or speculation, and does not intend to comment on any \n      future indications of interest from Enterprise or any other party.\n     \n     \n       Williams (WMB)  is a premier provider of large-scale \n      infrastructure connecting North American natural gas and natural gas \n      products to growing demand for cleaner fuel and feedstocks. \n      Headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., Williams owns approximately 60 percent of \n      Williams Partners L.P.

Third-Quarter 2016 Financial Results Williams Partners reported third-quarter 2016 unaudited net income of $326 million, compared to a $194 million net loss from third-quarter 2015. The favorable change was driven by the absence of $461 million of impairments of equity-method investments recognized in 2015.\u00a0The improvement also reflected higher olefins margins at our Geismar plant, lower operating and maintenance (O&M) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and higher service revenues associated with expansion projects, partially offset by a $32 million additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of our Canadian operations and expensed project development costs. Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported unaudited net income of $286 million, a $91 million increase over the same time period in 2015. The favorable change was driven by lower impairments of equity-method investments, higher service revenues, an increase in olefins margins associated with our Geismar plant, decreases in O&M and SG&A expenses, and higher equity earnings. These favorable changes were partially offset by increased property-impairment charges and the additional loss on sale associated with our Canadian operations, the absence of $126 million of insurance recoveries, and higher interest incurred. Williams Partners reported third-quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.189 billion, an $89 million increase over third-quarter 2015. The increase is due primarily to $37 million higher fee-based revenues, $33 million higher olefins margins and $21 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses. Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $3.314 billion, an increase of $289 million over the same nine-month reporting period in 2015. The increase is due primarily to $108 million of higher olefins margins, $99 million of higher fee-based revenues, $83 million of lower O&M and SG&A expenses and $50 million of higher proportional EBITDA from joint ventures. Partially offsetting these increases was a $19 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our former Canadian operations divested in September 2016. Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions For third-quarter 2016, Williams Partners generated $795 million in distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, compared with $754 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations for the same period last year. The $41 million increase in DCF for the quarter was driven by an $89 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by $25 million higher interest expense. For third-quarter 2016, the cash distribution coverage was 1.08x. Year-to-date, Williams Partners generated $2.271 billion in DCF, an increase of $170 million over the same period in 2015. The increase was due to a $289 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA partially offset by $100 million higher interest expense. Year-to-date, the cash distribution coverage was 1.04x. Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders payable on Nov. 14, 2016 to unitholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 4, 2016. In August 2016, Williams reinvested $250 million via a private placement to purchase WPZ common units pursuant to its previously announced plans. CEO Perspective Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general partner, made the following comments: \u201cWith Adjusted EBITDA growth across all five of the partnership\u2019s operating areas and increased distributable cash flow achieved by Williams Partners, our strong third-quarter results highlighted once again the effectiveness of our strategy and how well-positioned we are to capture natural gas demand growth now and in the future. \u201cOur recent accomplishments reflect disciplined execution against our business plan. The new Kodiak, Gunflint and Rock Springs facilities all contributed to our growth in the third quarter. Despite the expanding number of major projects recently placed in-service, we reduced expenses on a year-to-date basis. We also completed win-win contract renegotiations with our customer Chesapeake and completed the sale of our Canadian businesses as we continue to take decisive actions to position our company for predictable growth. \u201cOur future growth is also visible in the number of projects now under construction. After receiving the necessary permits to begin construction, we began work in the third quarter on Dalton, Virginia Southside II and Phase 1 of Hillabee. Construction on our New York Bay Expansion project began this month while construction also continues on our Gulf Trace project. We are aiming to place all of these Transco-expansion projects into service next year.\u201d Business Segment Results \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Williams Partners \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA Amounts in millions \u00a0 \u00a0 3Q 2016 \u00a0 3Q 2016 \u00a0 \u00a0 3Q 2015 \u00a0 3Q 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 YTD 2016 \u00a0 \u00a0 YTD 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified     EBITDA \u00a0 Adjust. \u00a0 Adjusted     EBITDA \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified     EBITDA \u00a0 Adjust. \u00a0 Adjusted     EBITDA \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified     EBITDA \u00a0 Adjust. \u00a0 Adjusted     EBITDA \u00a0 \u00a0 Modified     EBITDA \u00a0 Adjust. \u00a0 Adjusted     EBITDA Atlantic-Gulf \u00a0 \u00a0 $416 \u00a0 $11 \u00a0 $427 \u00a0 \u00a0 $414 \u00a0 $ - \u00a0 \u00a0 $414 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,149 \u00a0 \u00a0 $42 \u00a0 $1,191 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,138 \u00a0 $ - \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,138 Central \u00a0 \u00a0 176 \u00a0 70 \u00a0 246 \u00a0 \u00a0 163 \u00a0 67 \u00a0 \u00a0 230 \u00a0 \u00a0 467 \u00a0 \u00a0 251 \u00a0 718 \u00a0 \u00a0 456 \u00a0 224 \u00a0 \u00a0 680 NGL & Petchem Services \u00a0 \u00a0 104 \u00a0 32 \u00a0 136 \u00a0 \u00a0 85 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 85 \u00a0 \u00a0 (104 ) \u00a0 377 \u00a0 273 \u00a0 \u00a0 249 \u00a0 (124 ) \u00a0 125 Northeast G&P \u00a0 \u00a0 208 \u00a0 6 \u00a0 214 \u00a0 \u00a0 189 \u00a0 19 \u00a0 \u00a0 208 \u00a0 \u00a0 638 \u00a0 \u00a0 11 \u00a0 649 \u00a0 \u00a0 557 \u00a0 52 \u00a0 \u00a0 609 West \u00a0 \u00a0 166 \u00a0 - \u00a0 166 \u00a0 \u00a0 169 \u00a0 (8 ) \u00a0 161 \u00a0 \u00a0 479 \u00a0 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 483 \u00a0 \u00a0 480 \u00a0 (7 ) \u00a0 473 Other \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 11 \u00a0 (11 ) \u00a0 - Total \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,070 \u00a0 $119 \u00a0 $1,189 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,021 \u00a0 $79 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,100 \u00a0 \u00a0 $2,629 \u00a0 \u00a0 $685 \u00a0 $3,314 \u00a0 \u00a0 $2,891 \u00a0 $134 \u00a0 \u00a0 $3,025 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Definitions of modified EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and schedules reconciling these measures to net income are included in this news release. \u00a0 Atlantic-Gulf Atlantic-Gulf operating area includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and 41 percent interest in Constitution interstate gas pipeline development project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment also includes the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production and handling and transportation in the Gulf Coast region. These operations include a 51 percent consolidated interest in Gulfstar One, a 50 percent equity method interest in Gulfstream and a 60 percent equity-method interest in the Discovery pipeline and processing system. Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $416 million for third-quarter 2016, compared with $414 million for third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $427 million for the same time period. The increase in Modified EBITDA is due primarily to $31 million higher fee-based revenues from both offshore gathering and processing operations (including the new Gunflint and Kodiak facilities) as well as Transco\u2019s new expansion projects. Substantially offsetting the higher fee-based revenues were $20 million in higher O&M expenses primarily related to pipeline safety testing activities as well as expensed project development costs. Year-to-date, Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $1.149 billion, an increase of $11 million over the same time period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million to $1.191 billion. The increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $27 million higher fee-based revenues from both Transco\u2019s new expansion projects as well as offshore gathering and processing operations (including the new Gunflint and Kodiak facilities) and $25 million higher proportional EBITDA from Discovery due to increased contributions from Keathley Canyon Connector. Modified EBITDA was also unfavorably impacted by potential rate refunds associated with litigation, severance-related costs, and project development costs, all of which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Central The Central operating area includes operations that were previously part of the former Access Midstream segment located in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. These operations became the Central operating area effective Jan. 1, 2016 and prior-period segment disclosures have been recast for this change. Central provides gathering, treating and compression services to producers under long-term, fee-based contracts. The segment also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region. The Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $176 million for third-quarter 2016, an increase of $13 million from third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million to $246 million. The increase is due primarily to $20 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses partially offset by lower fee-based revenues. Year-to-date, the Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of $11 million from the same nine-month reporting period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million to $718 million. The increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $63 million of lower O&M and SG&A expenses due to cost reduction efforts and the absence of certain merger and transition costs in the prior year partially offset by lower fee-based revenues and a $48 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 related to a gathering system. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impairment charge and benefits from the absence of prior-year merger and transition costs, as well as estimated minimum volume commitments. NGL & Petchem Services NGL & Petchem Services operating area includes an 88.5 percent undivided ownership interest in an olefins production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, along with a refinery grade propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment also includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50 percent equity-method interest in Overland Pass Pipeline. Prior to the sale of all of our Canadian-based assets effective Sept. 23, 2016, this segment included midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 261 miles of NGL and olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility at Redwater. NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $104 million for third-quarter 2016, compared with $85 million for third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $51 million to $136 million. The $19 million increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $33 million higher olefins margins and $8 million higher fee-based revenues. Geismar olefins margins for third-quarter 2016 reflected enhanced operational production levels and improved ethylene prices. Partially offsetting these increases was a $32 million additional loss associated with the completion of the sale of Canadian operations, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date, NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified EBITDA of ($104) million compared with $249 million during the same time period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $148 million to $273 million. The decrease in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to a second quarter 2016 non-cash impairment charge of $341 million associated with our former Canadian operations, the additional loss associated with the sale, and the absence of $126 million business interruption proceeds. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were $108 million favorable olefins margins at Geismar and $38 million favorable fee-based revenues due primarily to new fees associated with Williams\u2019 Canadian offgas processing plant that came online in first quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impairment charge, additional loss on sale and insurance proceeds. Northeast G&P Northeast G&P operating area includes the Susquehanna Supply Hub, Ohio Valley Midstream, Marcellus South, Bradford and Utica midstream gathering and processing operations as well as its 69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its 58.4 percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream. The Marcellus South, Bradford and Utica midstream gathering and processing operations that were previously within the former Access Midstream segment became part of Northeast G&P effective Jan. 1, 2016 and prior period segment disclosures have been recast for this change. Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $208 million for third-quarter 2016, compared with $189 million for third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $6 million to $214 million. The $19 million increase in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to $14 million of higher fee-based revenues. Year-to-date, Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $638 million, an increase of $81 million over the same period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $40 million to $649 million. The increase in Modified EBITDA is due primarily to higher fee-based revenues, lower O&M expenses, increased proportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments and the absence of certain 2015 impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the prior year impairment charges. West West operating area includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline interstate gas pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and treating operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area. West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $166 million for third-quarter 2016, compared with $169 million for third-quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $166 million is $5 million higher than the same period in 2015. The $3 million decrease in Modified EBITDA was due primarily to the absence of an $8 million insurance settlement recorded in 2015 and lower fee-based revenues, substantially offset by $7 million lower O&M and SG&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of the 2015 insurance settlement. Year-to-date, the West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $479 million compared with $480 million over the same period in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $483 million is $10 million higher than the same period in 2015 due primarily to lower O&M and SG&A expenses. Revised 2017 Growth Capital Guidance Related Primarily to Atlantic Sunrise Project Timing Williams Partners is revising its 2017 growth capital\u00a0guidance amounts due primarily to the shift in Transco and related Northeast G&P growth spending caused by the revised Atlantic Sunrise in-service date, as well as new projects and other changes. As discussed in its press release dated Oct. 28, 2016, Williams Partners expects partial Atlantic Sunrise service to begin during the second half of 2017 and is now targeting full in-service during mid-2018. Consistent with prior financial practice, Williams Partners\u2019 financial plan further risks these project cash flows by approximately six months. The following guidance range represents both the targeted in-service date and the further risked in-service date: total 2017 growth capital and investment expenditures are expected to be between $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion, including total 2017 growth capital for Transco, which is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion.

Form 10-Q The company plans to file its third-quarter 2016 Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites. Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method investments. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations. We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments. We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss). This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles."},

(NYSE: WMB) (\u201cWilliams\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), \n      in response to comments from Keith Meister of Corvex Management LP \n      (\u201cCorvex\u201d) that Corvex intends to nominate 10 of its employees to stand \n      for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors at the 2016 Annual \n      Meeting of Stockholders, issued the following statement:\n     \n     \n      Given the events of the last year, it is unfortunate that Corvex intends \n      to launch a distracting and costly proxy contest while Williams is \n      moving forward with its plan to identify new, highly qualified and \n      independent directors.\n     \n     \n      The Williams Board maintains open communications with stockholders, \n      welcomes their input and perspective, and is committed to acting in \n      their best interests. In that regard, after discussions with Corvex and \n      other Williams stockholders, Williams intends to appoint three new, \n      independent directors to its Board of Directors prior to the Company\u2019s \n      2016 Annual Meeting. The Board\u2019s comprehensive process to identify \n      additional highly qualified directors is underway, and Williams expects \n      to announce new Board appointments in the coming weeks. Williams is \n      committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and to \n      maintaining a world-class Board that comprises directors with \n      appropriate expertise, experience and skills.\n     \n     \n      The Board believes that it is important that the new directors who will \n      be appointed in the coming weeks participate in Board discussions \n      regarding the composition of the Board going forward. The Board reached \n      out to Mr. Meister regarding the Corvex proposal and indicated that \n      including the new directors in Board deliberations would allow the Board \n      to take immediate advantage of the expertise, experience and insight of \n      the new directors. Therefore, the Board indicated it would promptly make \n      a determination on the Corvex proposal once the new Board members are \n      appointed.\n     \n     \n      Notably, since early July, the Williams management team has announced a \n      series of actions, including its strategic plan, and the Company\u2019s stock \n      has increased in value by approximately 35%.\n     \n     \n       \n        Williams and Williams Partners announced immediate measures designed \n        to enhance their values, strengthen their credit profile and fund the \n        development of a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at \n        Williams Partners, while maintaining flexibility as financial and \n        operational plans are being reviewed.\n       \n       \n        Williams Partners expects to implement a Distribution Reinvestment \n        Program (DRIP); Williams intends to reinvest approximately $1.7 \n        billion into Williams Partners through 2017, funded by reduced \n        quarterly cash dividends.\n       \n       \n        Williams Partners announced that it has conditionally committed to \n        execute a new gas gathering agreement with a new producer customer, a \n        private company successor to Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK), in the \n        Barnett Shale. Additionally, Williams Partners and Chesapeake agreed \n        to a revised contract in the Mid-Continent region.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced that Transcontinental \n      Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) has filed an application with the \n      Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking authorization to \n      construct a 475,000 dekatherm per day (Dth/d) expansion in Texas and \n      Louisiana to connect U.S. natural gas supplies with global liquefied \n      natural gas (LNG) markets.\n     \n     \n      Constructed in two phases, the Gulf Connector Project is designed to \n      deliver 75,000 Dth/d to Freeport LNG Development, L.P.\u2019s liquefaction \n      project by the second half of 2018, and 400,000 Dth/d to Cheniere \n      Energy\u2019s Corpus Christi liquefaction terminal in 2019. Pending \n      appropriate regulatory approvals, construction on the first phase of the \n      project will begin in the third quarter of 2017 in order to be placed \n      into service during the second half of 2018.\n     \n     \n      Both of the liquefaction facilities are currently under construction. \n      The Freeport LNG export terminal will have three liquefaction trains \n      with expected aggregate export capacity of 15.3 million tonnes per annum \n      (mtpa) and is planned to commence operations in phases between September \n      2018 and August 2019. Cheniere Energy\u2019s Corpus Christi liquefaction \n      terminal is proposed to have up to five liquefaction trains (two of \n      which are under construction) with expected aggregate nominal production \n      capacity of up to 22.5 mtpa of LNG.\u00a0Trains one and two at the Corpus \n      Christi liquefaction terminal are expected to reach substantial \n      completion in 2019.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis project underscores how the abundance of natural gas in the U.S. \n      is changing the global energy landscape,\u201d said Rory Miller, senior vice \n      president of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf operating area. \u201cThe U.S. \n      is projected to become the world\u2019s third-largest LNG supplier in five \n      years. Projects like Gulf Connector, which leverage existing gas \n      pipeline infrastructure, make it possible to connect abundant domestic \n      supply with emerging international markets, giving a boost to the U.S. \n      economy while helping meet the world\u2019s increasing energy needs.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is well-positioned to take advantage of the projected \n      surge in LNG demand growth, as its Transco pipeline passes through every \n      U.S. state with an LNG export facility currently under construction. \n      Natural gas demand to serve LNG export facilities along the Transco \n      pipeline is expected to grow by approximately 11,000 MDth/d by 2025.\n     \n     \n      The Gulf Connector Project involves adding compression and making the \n      natural gas flow bi-directional on a portion of the Transco system \n      between Louisiana and South Texas. The project has been designed to \n      provide incremental firm transportation from Transco\u2019s Station 65 in St. \n      Helena Parish, La. to mainline interconnects with proposed header \n      pipelines in Wharton County, Texas and San Patricio County, Texas.\n     \n     \n      The project, which is included in Williams Partners\u2019 2016 and 2017 \n      growth capital plan that includes $1.3 billion in 2016 and $2.4 billion \n      in 2017 for Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth \n      projects, is fully subscribed by Osaka Gas Trading & Export, LLC, whose \n      affiliate is a limited partner of Freeport LNG Development, L.P., and \n      Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC, a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy. Both \n      have executed long-term, firm transportation agreements with Transco.\n     \n     \n      As previously announced, Williams Partners is also building the Gulf \n      Trace Project to serve Cheniere Energy\u2019s Sabine Pass Liquefaction \n      project in Cameron Parish, La., the first large-scale LNG export \n      facility in operation in the continental United States. The Gulf Trace \n      Project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.\n     \n     \n      Transco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Partners, of which \n      Williams (NYSE: WMB) owns controlling interests and is the general \n      partner. Transco is the nation\u2019s largest and fastest-growing interstate \n      natural gas transmission pipeline system. It delivers natural gas to \n      customers through its 10,200-mile pipeline network whose mainline \n      extends nearly 1,800 miles between South Texas and New York City. The \n      system provides cost-effective natural gas services to U.S. markets in \n      the Southeast and Atlantic seaboard states, including major metropolitan \n      areas in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as international \n      markets.\n     \n     \n      "},

The plant is a \n      predominantly ethane-fed, light-end natural gas liquids cracker. \n      Williams has held an ownership stake in the Geismar plant since 1999.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis premiere olefins-production facility on the Gulf Coast benefits \n      from a recent expansion, access to significant U.S. shale gas reserves, \n      proximity to a variety of transport logistics options and an experienced \n      team of employees who have run the facility safely and reliably since \n      the expanded plant came into operation,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief \n      executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general partner.\n     \n     \n      \u201cGiven the attractive long-term outlook for U.S. ethylene crackers, we \n      believe our Geismar plant presents an attractive investment opportunity \n      for potential buyers, especially those seeking to quickly backward \n      integrate into ethylene in the U.S. Gulf Coast,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cIn \n      addition, we believe this asset provides an attractive value proposition \n      for those considering the timing and cost-overrun risks of building a \n      new ethylene facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast in the coming years.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Armstrong added, \u201cWe believe the potential monetization of this asset \n      would create significant value for Williams Partners and our decision to \n      explore alternatives with respect to the Geismar olefins plant is \n      consistent with Williams\u2019 strategy to narrow its focus and allocate \n      capital to its strong core, natural gas-focused business.\u201d\n     \n     \n      If the process results in a sale, Williams Partners would expect to use \n      a portion of the proceeds to reduce debt in order to maintain \n      investment-grade credit metrics and the balance of the proceeds would \n      reduce planned equity issuances.\n     \n     \n      This Geismar announcement follows the Aug. 8, 2016 announcement by the \n      partnership and Williams that they have agreed to sell their Canadian \n      businesses to Inter Pipeline Ltd. for combined cash proceeds of $1.35 \n      billion CAD. The Canadian transaction is expected to close in 2016.\n     \n     \n      "},

\n     \n       Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results \n     \n     \n      Due primarily to a $747 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge \n      associated with held for sale Canadian operations, Williams reported a \n      second quarter 2016 unaudited net loss of $405 million, an unfavorable \n      change of $519 million from second quarter 2015. The decrease also \n      reflects the absence of $126 million of Geismar insurance proceeds from \n      the prior year, partially offset by lower costs and expenses.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams reported an unaudited net loss of $470 million, \n      an unfavorable change of $654 million from the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015, due primarily to the items affecting the second quarter. \n      The year-to-date decrease also reflects $112 million associated with the \n      first quarter impairment of certain equity-method investments and higher \n      interest expense, partially offset by improved olefins margins and \n      increased contributions from Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported second quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.065 billion, \n      a $48 million increase over second quarter 2015. The improvement is due \n      primarily to a $57 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA from the Williams \n      Partners segment, partially offset by a $9 million decrease for the \n      Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment.\n     \n     \n      Year-to date, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.121 billion, an \n      increase of $186 million over the same six-month reporting period in \n      2015. The improvement is due primarily to a $200 million increase in \n      Adjusted EBITDA from the Williams Partners segment, partially offset by \n      an $18 million decrease at the Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe own the premier natural gas focused asset base, and our strong \n      performance in the second quarter once again demonstrates that our \n      strategy positions Williams like no other company to benefit from \n      growing natural gas demand. In fact, we currently have projects in \n      negotiation or execution to add 7.6 Bcf per day of capacity to markets \n      served by Transco through 2020, which amounts to 65 percent of Wood \n      Mackenzie\u2019s 5-year projected demand growth for natural gas along \n      Transco\u2019s corridor. In 2018, we expect to have twice as much \n      fully-contracted capacity on Transco as we did in 2010. Quarter after \n      quarter, the significant advantages of increased fee-based revenues are \n      evident as we bring demand-driven projects into service. Additionally, \n      as we execute on current projects, our assets continue to attract a \n      steady number of requests for new market area capacity.\n     \n     \n      \u201cEarly in 2016 we embarked on several actions, including cost reduction \n      initiatives, to address the realities of slower growth in key supply \n      areas.\u00a0We executed quickly on these actions and are already realizing \n      the benefits of these efforts in the current quarter and expect \n      additional traction in subsequent quarters.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAs we move forward, our organization is fully aligned, energized and \n      focused on simplifying the way we operate and make decisions. We are \n      committed to executing on our projects, lowering our overall risk, and \n      driving stockholder value by delivering on our growth strategy and \n      strengthening our balance sheet.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem

    Williams Partners reported second quarter 2016 Modified EBITDA of $604 \n      million, a decrease of $449 million from second quarter 2015. This \n      decrease occurred due primarily to a $341 million impairment charge \n      associated with Williams Partners\u2019 held-for-sale Canadian operations, \n      the absence in 2016 of $126 million in business interruption proceeds \n      from the 2013 Geismar Olefins plant incident that were recorded in \n      second quarter 2015, a $48 million impairment charge related to a \n      gathering system, and $34 million lower fee-based revenues at Gulfstar \n      One caused by a planned shutdown to connect the Gunflint tieback and \n      other activity by producers on their wells. These were partially offset \n      by lower operating and G&A expenses despite additional assets being in \n      service, and other increases in fee-based revenue associated with \n      Transco expansion projects.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $1.559 \n      billion, a decrease of $311 million from the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the Canadian and \n      gathering system impairments and absence of insurance proceeds, \n      partially offset by $75 million of higher olefins margins reflecting a \n      full six months of Geismar Olefins plant production, $66 million higher \n      joint-venture EBITDA primarily from Discovery and lower operating and \n      G&A costs.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.065 \n      billion, a $57 million increase. The increase was largely driven by a \n      $55 million improvement in operating and G&A costs.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.125 \n      billion, an increase of $200 million over the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is due to higher olefins \n      margins, contributions from Discovery, and lower operating and G&A costs.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for second quarter 2016 \n      are provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams \n      Partners.\n     \n     \n       Williams NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment includes an offgas processing \n      plant in Canada at CNRL\u2019s Horizon upgrader that went into service in \n      first quarter 2016. The segment also includes a propane dehydrogenation \n      facility growth project under development as well as petchem pipeline \n      projects on the Gulf Coast.\n     \n     \n      Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported second quarter 2016 Modified \n      EBITDA of $(429) million, a decrease of $426 million from second quarter \n      2015. The decrease is due primarily to a $406 million impairment of \n      held-for-sale Canadian operations and $11 million of project development \n      costs.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported Modified EBITDA \n      of $(467) million, a decrease of $459 million over the same six-month \n      reporting period in 2015. The decrease is due primarily to the \n      previously mentioned impairment and $45 million of project development \n      costs.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Expects to Implement Distribution Reinvestment \n      Program (DRIP); Williams Intends to Reinvest Approximately $1.7 Billion \n      into Williams Partners through 2017, Funded by Reduced Quarterly Cash \n      Dividend \n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners announced immediate measures designed to \n      enhance values, strengthen their credit profile and fund the development \n      of a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams \n      Partners, while maintaining flexibility as they continue to review \n      financial and operational plans.\n     \n     \n      Williams intends to reinvest approximately $1.7 billion into Williams \n      Partners through 2017, funded by reduced quarterly cash dividends.\n     \n     \n      Williams plans to reinvest $500 million into Williams Partners in 2016 \n      including $250 million in the third quarter via a private purchase of \n      common units with the balance in the fourth quarter via the DRIP. An \n      additional $1.2 billion is planned to be reinvested in 2017 via the DRIP.\n     \n     \n      Williams expects the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share \n      to its common stockholders ($0.80 annually), reduced from its current \n      quarterly level of $0.64 ($2.56 annually), beginning with the third \n      quarter 2016 dividend payable in September 2016. This dividend level \n      will allow Williams to annually retain approximately $1.3 billion that \n      can be reinvested into Williams Partners to enhance its ability to \n      maintain its distribution and increase its distribution coverage, while \n      providing the partnership with the flexibility to reduce debt and \n      maintain its investment grade ratings.\n     \n     \n      The DRIP is expected to be activated in the third quarter of 2016 and \n      available for the quarterly cash distribution that will be paid to \n      limited partners in November of 2016. Williams Partners expects the DRIP \n      will enable limited partner unitholders to reinvest all or a portion of \n      the quarterly cash distributions they would receive from their ownership \n      of limited partner units to purchase common units.\n     \n     \n       Ongoing Initiatives Continue to Strengthen Williams Partners\u2019 Credit \n      Profile \n     \n     \n      In addition to the implementation of the DRIP program, the Company \n      confirmed that:\n     \n     \n       \n        Williams and Williams Partners expect to finalize the agreement on the \n        sale of their Canadian business during the third quarter of 2016, with \n        expected combined proceeds in excess of $1 billion, with Williams \n        Partners\u2019 share in excess of $800 million, further reducing external \n        capital-funding needs;\n       \n       \n        Williams continues to make significant progress on its ongoing cost \n        reduction program, with $55 million in lower adjusted costs at \n        Williams Partners for second quarter 2016 versus the prior year period \n        despite additional assets being in service; additional cost-savings \n        initiatives are planned in the balance of the year;\n       \n       \n        Williams Partners plans to access the public equity market via \n        Williams Partners\u2019 ATM program or other means and may access the \n        public debt market as needed while maintaining investment grade credit \n        metrics.\n       \n     \n     \n       Second-Quarter 2016 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A Webcast \n      Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 second quarter 2016 financial results package will be posted \n      shortly at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners plan to jointly host a Q&A live webcast \n      on Tuesday, Aug. 2 at 9:30 a.m. EDT. A limited number of phone lines \n      will be available at 800-723-6604. International callers should dial \n      785-830-7977. The conference ID is 4335926. A link to the webcast, as \n      well as replays of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable \n      podcast formats, will be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its second quarter 2016 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams\u2019 websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash \n      available for dividends, and dividend coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP \n      financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends is defined as cash received from our \n      ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by the Williams NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends \n      relative to actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are \n      they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from \n      operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes \n      for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States \n      generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The \n      decrease also reflects the absence of $126 million of Geismar insurance \n      proceeds from the prior year and a $48 million impairment charge in 2016 \n      related to a gathering system. These changes were partially offset by \n      lower costs and expenses, as well as a foreign tax provision impact \n      associated with the Canadian impairment charge.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date Williams Partners reported unaudited net loss of $40 \n      million, an unfavorable change of $429 million for the same six-month \n      reporting period in 2015 due primarily to the items affecting the second \n      quarter. The year-to-date decrease also reflects the first quarter \n      impairment of certain equity-method investments and higher interest \n      expense, partially offset by improved olefins margins and increased \n      contributions from Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.065 \n      billion, a $57 million increase over second quarter 2015. The increase \n      is due primarily to $55 million lower G&A and operating expenses, \n      despite additional assets being in service. Fee-based revenues, which \n      were steady versus second quarter 2015, were impacted by a $34 million \n      reduction at Gulfstar One resulting from a planned shutdown to connect \n      the Gunflint tieback, partially offset by higher revenues from Transco \n      expansion projects.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.125 \n      billion, an increase of $200 million over the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015. The increase is due primarily to $75 million of higher \n      olefins margins, $61 million of higher fee-based revenues, $61 million \n      of lower operating and G&A expenses and $52 million of higher \n      proportional EBITDA from joint ventures. Partially offsetting these \n      increases were certain unfavorable items including a $15 million change \n      in foreign currency exchange gains and losses.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow and Distributions \n     \n     \n      For second quarter 2016, Williams Partners generated $737 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $701 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      for the same period last year. The $36 million increase in DCF for the \n      quarter was driven by a $57 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA, \n      partially offset by $38 million higher interest expense. The cash \n      distribution coverage was 1.02x versus 0.97x in second quarter 2015.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Williams Partners generated $1.476 billion in DCF, an \n      increase of $129 million in DCF over the same six-month reporting period \n      in 2015. The increase was due to a $200 million increase in Adjusted \n      EBITDA partially offset by $75 million higher interest expense. The cash \n      distribution coverage for the first six-month reporting period was 1.02x \n      versus 0.93x for the same six-month period in 2015.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe own the premier natural gas focused asset base, and our strong \n      performance in the second quarter once again demonstrates that our \n      strategy positions Williams like no other company to benefit from \n      growing natural gas demand. In fact, we currently have projects in \n      negotiation or execution to add 7.6 Bcf per day of capacity to markets \n      served by Transco through 2020, which amounts to 65 percent of Wood \n      Mackenzie\u2019s 5-year projected demand growth for natural gas along \n      Transco\u2019s corridor. In 2018, we expect to have twice as much \n      fully-contracted capacity on Transco as we did in 2010. Quarter after \n      quarter, the significant advantages of increased fee-based revenues are \n      evident as we bring demand-driven projects into service. Additionally, \n      as we execute on current projects, our assets continue to attract a \n      steady number of requests for new market area capacity.\n     \n     \n      \u201cEarly in 2016 we embarked on several actions, including cost reduction \n      initiatives, to address the realities of slower growth in key supply \n      areas.\u00a0We executed quickly on these actions and are already realizing \n      the benefits of these efforts in the current quarter and expect \n      additional traction in subsequent quarters.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAs we move forward, our organization is fully aligned, energized and \n      focused on simplifying the way we operate and make decisions. We are \n      committed to executing on our projects, lowering our overall risk, and \n      driving stockholder value by delivering on our growth strategy and \n      strengthening our balance

The \n      $32 million decrease is due primarily to $34 million lower fee-based \n      revenues at Gulfstar One caused by a planned month-long shutdown to \n      connect the Gunflint tieback, and other activity by producers on their \n      wells partially offset by $17 million higher fee-based revenues in other \n      areas \u2013 primarily from Transco\u2019s new expansion projects. Results also \n      reflect an increase in operating costs.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Atlantic-Gulf reported Modified EBITDA of $733 million, an \n      increase of $9 million over the same six-month reporting period in 2015. \n      The increase was primarily due to $28 million higher proportional EBITDA \n      from Discovery due to increased contributions from Keathley Canyon \n      Connector and $55 million higher fee-based revenues on Transco primarily \n      associated with expansion projects. These increases were partially \n      offset by $41 million of lower fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One, \n      primarily from the second quarter 2016 month-long shutdown to connect \n      the Gunflint tieback and other activity by producers on their wells. \n      Results were also unfavorably impacted by potential rate refunds \n      associated with litigation, severance-related costs, and Constitution \n      project development costs, all of which are excluded from Adjusted \n      EBITDA.\n     \n     \n       Central \n     \n     \n      Central operating area includes operations that were previously part of \n      the former Access Midstream segment located in Louisiana, Texas, \n      Arkansas and Oklahoma. These operations became the Central operating \n      area effective Jan. 1, 2016 and prior period segment disclosures have \n      been recast to reflect this change. Central provides gathering, treating \n      and compression services to producers under long-term, fee-based \n      contracts. The segment also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest \n      in the Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region.\n     \n     \n      The Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $134 million for \n      second quarter 2016, a decrease of $26 million from second quarter 2015. \n      The decrease is due primarily to a $48 million impairment charge related \n      to a gathering system. The impairment was partially offset by lower \n      operating and G&A expenses. The non-cash impairment charge is excluded \n      from Adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the Central operating area reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $291 million, a decrease of $2 million from the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the previously \n      mentioned impairment charge, partially offset by lower operating and G&A \n      expenses due to cost reduction efforts and the absence of certain merger \n      and transition costs in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $22 \n      million, excluding the impairment charge and benefits from the absence \n      of prior year merger and transition costs.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services operating area includes an 88.5 percent interest \n      in an olefins production facility in Geismar, La., along with a refinery \n      grade propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This \n      segment also includes midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, along \n      with an oil sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 261 miles \n      of NGL and olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility \n      at Redwater. This segment also includes the partnership\u2019s energy \n      commodities marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage \n      facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent equity-method interest in \n      Overland Pass Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified EBITDA of ($261) \n      million for second quarter 2016, compared with Modified EBITDA of $158 \n      million for second quarter 2015. The $419 million decrease was due \n      primarily to the previously discussed impairment charge associated with \n      Canadian operations and absence in second quarter 2016 of the $126 \n      million business interruption proceeds, partially offset by higher \n      fee-based revenues and olefins margins. Geismar olefins margins for \n      second quarter 2016 were favorable by $12 million, reflecting strong \n      operational production levels negatively impacted by lower ethylene \n      prices. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of the impairment \n      charge and insurance proceeds, increased by $47 million reflecting the \n      higher fee-based revenues and olefins margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, NGL & Petchem Services operating area reported Modified \n      EBITDA of ($208) million compared with $164 million during the same \n      six-month reporting period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to \n      the previously discussed impairment charge and absence in second quarter \n      2016 of the $126 million business interruption proceeds and $15 million \n      of unfavorable foreign exchange activity related to the partnership\u2019s \n      Canadian business. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were $72 \n      million favorable olefins margins at Geismar and $30 million favorable \n      fee-based revenues due primarily to new fees associated with Williams\u2019 \n      Canadian offgas processing plant that came online in first quarter 2016 \n      at CNRL\u2019s upgrader. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impairment \n      charge and insurance proceeds, increased by $97 million.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P operating area now includes the Marcellus South, Bradford \n      and Utica midstream gathering and processing operations that were within \n      the former Access Midstream segment. These operations became part of \n      Northeast G&P effective Jan. 1, 2016 and prior period segment \n      disclosures have been recast to reflect this change. Northeast G&P also \n      includes the Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well \n      as its 69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and \n      its 58.4-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II \n      owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $216 million \n      for second quarter 2016, compared with $183 million for second quarter \n      2015. The quarter to quarter increase was due primarily to $25 million \n      lower operating and G&A expenses and the absence of $20 million in \n      certain asset impairment charges recorded in second quarter 2015. \n      Adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million and excludes the prior year \n      impairments.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, Northeast G&P operating area reported Modified EBITDA of \n      $430 million, an increase of $62 million over the same six-month \n      reporting period in 2015. The increase is due primarily to lower \n      operating and G&A expenses, increased proportional Modified EBITDA of \n      equity-method investments, higher fee-based revenues, and the absence of \n      certain 2015 impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 \n      million and excludes the prior year impairment charges.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      West operating area includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline \n      interstate gas pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and \n      treating operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners \n      area.\n     \n     \n      West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $158 million for second \n      quarter 2016 compared with $150 million for second quarter 2015. The $8 \n      million increase was due primarily to lower operating and G&A expenses.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date, the West operating area reported Modified EBITDA of $313 \n      million compared with $311 million over the same six-month reporting \n      period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to lower operating and \n      G&A expenses. Year-to-date, the West operating area reported Adjusted \n      EBITDA of $317 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $312 million \n      over the same six-month reporting period in 2015.\n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Expects to Implement Distribution Reinvestment \n      Program (DRIP) in Third Quarter 2016; Williams Intends to Reinvest \n      Approximately $1.7 Billion into Williams Partners through 2017 \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams announced immediate measures designed to \n      enhance value, strengthen Williams Partners\u2019 credit profile and fund the \n      development of a significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at \n      Williams Partners, while maintaining flexibility to review financial and \n      operational plans.\n     \n     \n      Williams intends to reinvest approximately $1.7 billion into Williams \n      Partners through 2017.\n     \n     \n      Williams plans to reinvest $500 million into Williams Partners in 2016 \n      including $250 million in the third quarter via a private purchase of \n      common units with the balance reinvested in the fourth quarter via the \n      DRIP. An additional $1.2 billion is planned to be reinvested in 2017 via \n      the DRIP.\n     \n     \n      The DRIP is expected to be activated in the third quarter of 2016 and \n      available for the quarterly cash distribution that will be paid to \n      limited partners in November of 2016. Williams Partners expects the DRIP \n      will enable limited partner unitholders to reinvest all or a portion of \n      the quarterly cash distributions they would receive from their ownership \n      of limited partner units to purchase common units.\n     \n     \n       Ongoing Initiatives Continue to Strengthen Williams Partners\u2019 Credit \n      Profile \n     \n     \n      In addition to the implementation of the DRIP program, the partnership \n      confirmed that:\n     \n     \n       \n        Williams and Williams Partners expect to finalize the agreement on the \n        sale of their Canadian business during the third quarter of 2016, with \n        expected combined proceeds in excess of $1 billion, with Williams \n        Partners\u2019 share in excess of $800 million, further reducing external \n        capital-funding needs;\n       \n       \n        Williams Partners continues to make significant progress on its \n        ongoing cost reduction program, with $55 million in lower adjusted \n        costs for second quarter 2016 versus the prior year period despite \n        additional assets being in service;

A limited number of phone lines \n      will be available at 800-723-6604. International callers should dial \n      785-830-7977. The conference ID is 4335926. A link to the webcast, as \n      well as replays of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable \n      podcast formats, will be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its second quarter 2016 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified \n      EBITDA of equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures.

I \n      am writing about your opportunity to make a very important choice about \n      the future of your investment.\n     \n     \n      By way of background, on September 28, 2015, Williams executed a \n      definitive agreement to combine with ETE (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d). Under \n      the Merger Agreement, ETE will form a partnership that will be treated \n      as a corporation for tax purposes to be called Energy Transfer Corp LP \n      (\u201cETC\u201d), and ETC will merge with Williams and survive the merger.\n     \n     \n       LEADING PROXY ADVISORY FIRM ISS RECOMMENDS WILLIAMS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \n      \u201cFOR\u201d THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ETE \n     \n     \n      The Board is pleased that Institutional Shareholder Services (\u201cISS\u201d), a \n      leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance advisory firm, \n      has recommended that Williams stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger \n      Agreement with ETE. The Board urges stockholders to follow ISS\u2019 \n      recommendation by voting \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement at the upcoming \n      special meeting.\n     \n     \n       THE WILLIAMS BOARD CONTINUES TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE \"FOR\" THE \n      MERGER AGREEMENT \n     \n     \n      If all Williams\u2019 stockholders elect to receive all cash or all stock, \n      then each share of Williams common stock would receive $8.00 in cash and \n      1.5274 ETC common shares. The cash and unit consideration represents \n      $27.38 of value per Williams share based on the ETE closing price of \n      $12.69 as of June 14, 2016. Additionally, Williams plans to pay a \n      one-time $0.10 special dividend following closing. Given the significant \n      and certain value the transaction will provide, the Board urges you to \n      vote \"FOR\" the Merger Agreement.\n     \n     \n       STOCKHOLDERS TO BENEFIT FROM ENHANCED LONG-TERM VALUE PROSPECTS \n      THROUGH ONGOING PARTICIPATION IN A LARGER, MORE DIVERSE COMPANY \n     \n     \n       TRANSACTION SECURES SUBSTANTIAL VALUE CERTAINTY THROUGH CASH \n      CONSIDERATION AMIDST THE CURRENTLY VOLATILE ENERGY ENVIRONMENT \n     \n     \n      Key highlights of the transaction include:\n     \n     \n       \n         Enhanced scale, scope of operations and M&A opportunities : \n        The transaction will create the largest midstream franchise in North \n        America and the Board believes that the combined company will be \n        better positioned to compete in a dynamic midstream sector and a \n        challenging commodity price environment.\n       \n       \n         Significant synergies : In addition to the significant available \n        cost synergies, the combined company will benefit from commercial \n        synergies that are expected to result in increased EBITDA by 2020 of \n        more than $100 million (base case) to more than $500 million (upside \n        price case).\n       \n       \n         Complementary geographic footprint : ETE and Williams have \n        complementary geographic footprints, which the Board believes will \n        allow the combined company to be able to better serve customers \n        through the entire value chain across all major basins.\n       \n       \n         Upside exposure : The Board expects that, as market conditions \n        improve, Williams stockholders will be able to benefit from the upside \n        in the combined company\u2019s significant and diverse set of growth \n        opportunities. The Board also expects upside to the combined company\u2019s \n        commercial synergy targets as commodity prices improve and demand for \n        natural gas, NGL and crude supply increases.\n       \n       \n         Financial strength : The Board believes that the combined \n        company will be well-positioned to cost-effectively delever and \n        strengthen the balance sheet over time.\n       \n       \n         Certainty of value : The cash component of the merger \n        consideration is equivalent to exchanging 18% of Williams shares for \n        cash at a valuation of $43.50 per share. This cash component \n        represents ~29% of the current overall value of the merger \n        consideration (as of June 14, 2016) and provides a substantial value \n        cushion in the current commodity downturn.\n       \n     \n     \n       In summary, Williams stockholders will benefit \n      from enhanced long-term value prospects, while securing value certainty \n      in today\u2019s volatile energy market through the cash component of the \n      transaction consideration. \n     \n     \n       COMBINATION REDUCES RISKS INHERENT IN A WILLIAMS STANDALONE CASE; KEY \n      CONSIDERATIONS FOR WILLIAMS STANDALONE CASE \n     \n     \n      One of the key benefits of the transaction is that it reduces key risks \n      Williams would face as a standalone company.\n     \n     \n       \n        The Board believes that the combination spreads  customer \n        concentration risk  across a much broader base, and provides more \n        opportunities and flexibility to negotiate \u201cwin-win\u201d solutions with \n        Williams\u2019 large and important customer, Chesapeake.\n       \n       \n        The Board believes that the merger also reduces the risk that  Williams\u2019 \n        access to capital may be impaired  as a result of customer credit \n        issues. The combined company will have more levers to finance its \n        capital plan, including four MLP financing vehicles.\n       \n     \n     \n      In addition, set forth below are certain key considerations for Williams \n      stockholders.\n     \n     \n       \n        The Board believes that a standalone scenario would likely involve the  elimination \n        or a significant reduction of the WMB dividend  to prioritize \n        strengthening of its credit profile and increasing financial \n        flexibility.\n       \n       \n        While Williams is focused on continuing to improve its credit profile,  current \n        leverage metrics are higher than the targeted level and there is risk \n        for a credit rating downgrade if the merger is not completed . \n        Williams\u2019   consolidated current debt / 2016E EBITDA is ~6X.\n       \n     \n     \n       In a standalone scenario, levers available to \n      Williams to improve its balance sheet and delever over time would be \n      prioritized as follows: (1) dividend elimination or significant \n      reduction to fund growth and delever; (2) further capex reductions; (3) \n      asset sales; and (4) equity issuances to bolster the balance sheet and \n      liquidity .\n     \n     \n       TRANSACTION DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT \n     \n     \n      The transaction with ETE has been designed to protect the interests of \n      Williams\u2019 stockholders and to ensure that the Board is maximizing the \n      value of your investment. For example, under the Merger Agreement, a \n      contingent consideration right (\u201cCCR\u201d) attached to each ETC share \n      Williams stockholders receive strongly incents ETE to ensure trading \n      parity between ETC shares and ETE units for two years following closing. \n      In addition, a dividend equalization agreement through 2018 will ensure \n      that ETC shareholders will receive the same cash dividends as ETE \n      unitholders, if any.\n     \n     \n       STRONG ALIGNMENT OF ETC AND ETE INTERESTS \n     \n     \n      In addition to the CCR and dividend equalization agreement, the initial \n      ETC Board will include three independent directors and the initial \n      conflicts committee of the Board was approved by the existing Williams \n      Board. The conflicts committee will appoint its successor members going \n      forward.\n     \n     \n      The Board believes that ETE management\u2019s significant ownership in ETE \n      provides a high degree of incentive for ETE value creation. Notably, ETE \n      management owns ~28% of outstanding ETE units, with Kelcy Warren \n      personally owning ~18%. ETE management also has a strong track record of \n      creating value for unitholders. Since January 2010, ETE has generated \n      total shareholder return of ~135% (compared to ~60% for the Alerian MLP \n      Index and ~65% for WMB). 2 \n     \n     \n       ACT NOW BY ELECTING YOUR MERGER CONSIDERATION AND VOTING \u201cFOR\u201d THE \n      MERGER AGREEMENT ON THE ENCLOSED  WHITE  \n      PROXY CARD \n     \n     \n      On May 25, 2016, Williams announced that the Securities and Exchange \n      Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) declared effective the Registration Statement on Form \n      S-4 relating to the proposed transaction. The proxy statement, which \n      provides important information about the proposed transaction, has been \n      mailed to Williams stockholders.\n     \n     \n      The Board encourages you to act  today , not \n      only to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger Agreement, but to also elect the form of \n      consideration you wish to receive in the merger: ETC shares, cash, or a \n      mix of the two, subject to proration, as described in the proxy \n      statement.

As a result of the joint integration planning \n      process in early 2016 by Williams and ETE, a new synergies estimate was \n      built from the ground up, and the parties now estimate merger-related \n      synergies of only $126 million annually by 2020 (a difference of $1.874 \n      billion or 94%), and have further estimated that even if market \n      conditions return to their July 2015 levels, merger-related synergies \n      would be $543 million, not $2 billion.\n     \n     \n       Williams (NYSE:WMB)  is a premier provider of large-scale \n      infrastructure connecting North American natural gas and natural gas \n      products to growing demand for cleaner fuel and feedstocks. \n      Headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., Williams owns approximately 60 percent of \n      Williams Partners L.P.

While Williams appreciates that Glass Lewis \n      expects that the \u201cgreater scale and asset diversification provided by \n      the proposed transaction could potentially position the Company to \n      better manage the current challenging commodity price environment, \n      including by providing more diversified cash flows and a wide range of \n      potential strategic opportunities,\u201d the Glass Lewis recommendation fails \n      to reflect the potential upside in the transaction, the value certainty \n      provided by the cash component and the risks associated with a \n      standalone Williams.\n     \n     \n      Other key observations regarding Glass Lewis\u2019 recommendation include:\n     \n     \n       \n        In failing to assess the value of consideration being offered to \n        Williams stockholders in the transaction, Glass Lewis ignores the \n        significant acquisition premium being offered to those stockholders. \n        If Williams stockholders were to reinvest the cash consideration of \n        $8.10 per share in ETE stock at the current ETE share price (as of \n        June 17, 2016), Williams stockholders would own 74% of the combined \n        company, significantly in excess of Williams\u2019 proportionate value \n        contribution.\n       \n     \n     \n       \n        Glass Lewis mistakenly cites a revised aggregate pre-tax annual \n        corporate synergy total of $126 million in the base case. While the \n        expected commercial synergies have been revised to $126 million in the \n        base case and more than $500 million in the upside case, Glass Lewis\u2019 \n        analysis omitted the fact that there are also additional significant \n        material cost synergies that the companies expect to realize through \n        the transaction. The base case of commercial synergies is consistent \n        with the range of potential synergies considered by the Williams Board \n        in approving the merger and by Williams\u2019 financial advisors when \n        performing the analyses and arriving at their opinions.\n       \n       \n        Glass Lewis also improperly assumes that Williams\u2019 dividend will \n        continue at or near the current rate in its flawed analysis of the \n        cash to be received by Williams stockholders in the two scenarios.\n\n         \n           \n            Williams stockholders have a guaranteed $8.10 per share in cash in \n            the transaction. While dividends at both ETE and standalone \n            Williams are expected to be eliminated or significantly reduced, \n            even at Williams\u2019 historical dividend rate (without the expected \n            elimination or significant reduction) it would take more than 12 \n            quarters of dividends to equal the upfront cash in the \n            transaction. With the expected elimination or significant \n            reduction of the Williams dividend, the time frame elongates \n            substantially.\n           \n         \n       \n       \n        While Glass Lewis recognizes that the combined company will have \n        greater cash flow diversification, expanded options to manage debt and \n        other benefits over a standalone Williams, its recommendation appears \n        solely focused on higher initial leverage metrics at ETE. The analysis \n        is flawed and should incorporate other factors when evaluating \n        relative credit profiles:\n\n         \n           \n            While Williams is focused on continuing to improve its credit \n            profile, current leverage metrics are higher than its targeted \n            level, and there is risk for a credit rating downgrade if the \n            merger is not completed. Williams\u2019 consolidated current debt / \n            2016E EBITDA is ~6x.\n           \n           \n            Williams would also continue to face significant customer \n            concentration risk. Notably, Chesapeake accounted for 18% of \n            Williams\u2019 2015 revenues.\n           \n           \n            In addition to an expected elimination or significant reduction of \n            the Williams dividend, Williams may also need to supplement debt \n            reduction plans as needed by asset sales, potential IDR waivers \n            and equity issuances.\n           \n           \n            ETE indicated in the S-4 that it expects that the combined company \n            will have the ability to manage HoldCo leverage levels to \n            approximately 3.7x by 2018. In addition, anticipated consolidated \n            EBITDA is projected to increase by approximately $3 billion, or \n            29% between 2016 and 2018.\n           \n         \n       \n     \n     \n       ISS, EGAN-JONES AND PIRC RECOMMEND THAT WILLIAMS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \n      \u201cFOR\u201d THE \n \n MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ETE \n     \n     \n      Williams is pleased that ISS, Egan-Jones and PIRC have endorsed the \n      Williams and ETE transaction. The Company believes that the \n      recommendations further support Williams\u2019 view that adopting the merger \n      agreement with ETE is in the best interests of Williams stockholders.\n     \n     \n      In its recommendation, ISS stated, among other things, that:\n     \n     \n       \n        \u201cGiven there are two large shareholders on the Williams board, and the \n        entire board\u2019s commitment to doing the right thing for shareholders \n        (as perhaps most evident in the protections, as well as the economic \n        terms, it negotiated in the first place), it seems wiser to preserve \n        the value of the contract itself, and the potential value creation \n        opportunity of the combined company, by voting FOR the transaction, \n        and to entrust the board with evaluating and negotiating any prudent \n        revisions to terms.\u201d\n       \n       \n        \u201cA vote FOR the proposed transaction is warranted, despite the \n        additional strains brought on by a continued decline in commodity \n        prices, given the significant cash component of the consideration \n        payable on closing, the more diversified customer base of the combined \n        company, the upside exposure to significant growth opportunities such \n        as Lake Charles LNG, and the opportunity to own nearly half the equity \n        in a combined company anticipated to have much stronger free cash flow \n        \u2013 particularly as the oil and gas sector recovers \u2013 than Williams on a \n        standalone basis.\u201d\n       \n     \n     \n      In its recommendation,  \n Egan-Jones \n \n   stated, \n      among other things, that:\n     \n     \n       \n        \u201c\u2026Egan Jones views the proposed transaction to be a desirable approach \n        in maximizing shareholder value. After careful consideration, we \n        believe that approval of the merger agreement is in the best interests \n        of the Company and its shareholders and its advantages and \n        opportunities outweigh the risks associated to the transaction. As of \n        the Record Date, there were 750,569,517 shares of common stock \n        outstanding. We recommend a vote \u201cFOR\u201d this Proposal.\u201d\n       \n     \n     \n      In its report,  \n Glass, Lewis \n , too, \n      recognizes the ability for the combined company to manage leverage \n      solely through dividend reductions and the greater options available to \n      it over a standalone Williams, stating:\n     \n     \n       \n        \u201cETE\u2019s projections do not require any additional asset sales to \n        delever and the combined company would likely have significant \n        additional opportunities to improve its financial position than WMB on \n        a stand-alone basis.\u201d\n       \n     \n     \n       THE WILLIAMS BOARD CONTINUES TO RECOMMEND \n \n THAT \n      STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \"FOR\" THE MERGER AGREEMENT \n     \n     \n      As previously stated, key highlights of the transaction include:\n     \n     \n       \n         Enhanced scale, scope of operations and M&A opportunities : \n        The transaction will create the largest midstream franchise in North \n        America and the Board believes that the combined company will be \n        better positioned to compete in a dynamic midstream sector and a \n        challenging commodity price environment.\n       \n       \n         Significant synergies : In addition to the significant available \n        cost synergies, the combined company will benefit from commercial \n        synergies that are expected to result in increased EBITDA by 2020 of \n        more than $100 million (base case) to more than $500 million (upside \n        price case).\n       \n       \n         Complementary geographic footprint : ETE and Williams have \n        complementary geographic footprints, which the Board believes will \n        allow the combined company to be able to better serve customers \n        through the entire value chain across all major basins.\n       \n       \n         Upside exposure : The Board expects that, as market conditions \n        improve, Williams stockholders will be able to benefit from the upside \n        in the combined company\u2019s significant and diverse set of growth \n        opportunities. The Board also expects upside to the combined company\u2019s \n        commercial synergy targets as commodity prices improve and demand for \n        natural gas, NGL and crude supply increases. As disclosed in the \n        Recent Developments section of the S-4 (under Updated Financial \n        Forecasts of ETC), anticipated consolidated EBITDA is projected to \n        increase by approximately $3 billion, or 29% between 2016 and 2018, \n        while the unconsolidated leverage metric of the combined company is \n        expected to decline from 6.8x HoldCo debt / EBITDA to 3.7x over the \n        2016 to 2018 timeframe.\n       \n       \n         Financial strength : The Board believes that the combined \n        company will be well-positioned to cost-effectively delever and \n        strengthen the balance sheet over time.\n       \n       \n         Certainty of value : The cash component of the merger \n        consideration is equivalent to exchanging 18% of Williams shares for \n        cash at a valuation of $43.50 per share. This cash component \n        represents ~29% of the current overall value of the merger \n        consideration (as of June 17, 2016) and provides a substantial value \n        cushion in the current commodity downturn.\n       \n     \n     \n      The transaction also reduces key risks Williams would face as a \n      standalone company:\n     \n     \n       \n        The Board believes that the combination spreads  customer \n        concentration risk  across a much broader base, and provides more \n        opportunities and flexibility to negotiate \u201cwin-win\u201d solutions with \n        Williams\u2019 large and important customer, Chesapeake.\n       \n       \n        The Board believes that the merger also reduces the risk that  Williams\u2019 \n        access to capital may be impaired  as a result of customer credit \n        issues. The combined company will have more levers to finance its \n        capital plan, including four MLP financing vehicles.\n       \n     \n     \n       ACT NOW BY ELECTING YOUR MERGER CONSIDERATION AND VOTING \u201cFOR\u201d THE \n      MERGER AGREEMENT ON THE ENCLOSED  WHITE  \n      PROXY CARD \n     \n     \n      The Board encourages stockholders to act today, not only to vote \u201cFOR\u201d \n      the Merger Agreement, but to also elect the form of consideration they \n      wish to receive in the merger: ETC shares, cash, or a mix of the two, \n      subject to proration, as described in the proxy statement. Stockholders\u2019 \n      financial advisors (bank or broker) can assist in making this election. \n      Regardless of the merger consideration election, the total amount of \n      cash to be paid will be limited to and fixed at approximately $6.05 \n      billion. Stockholders who do not elect cash may not receive any cash, \n      and similarly, stockholders who fail to make an election by the June \n      24th election deadline may not receive any cash.\n     \n     \n      Voting now is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares \n      are owned. Failing to vote has the same effect as a vote against the \n      transaction.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced it has conditionally \n      committed to execute a new gas gathering agreement with a new producer \n      customer, a private company successor to Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK), \n      in the Barnett Shale. Williams Partners\u2019 agreements with Chesapeake, \n      including Chesapeake\u2019s Minimum Volume Commitment (MVC) obligations in \n      the Barnett Shale, will be terminated at closing. Among other \n      conditions, the commitment is subject to the closing of the sale of \n      Chesapeake\u2019s Barnett assets to the producer customer, which is subject \n      to certain significant closing conditions including the receipt of \n      third-party consents. The new gas gathering agreement is expected to be \n      executed in the third quarter of 2016 when the Chesapeake sale is \n      expected to close.\n     \n\n\n     \n      Additionally, Williams Partners and Chesapeake announced they have \n      agreed to a revised contract in the Mid-Continent region, subject to the \n      payment of $66 million by Chesapeake.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThese agreements will create a win-win commitment that results in both \n      short- and long-term benefits for Williams Partners,\u201d said Alan \n      Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner. \u201cChesapeake is a great customer and an efficient operator; we \n      look forward to a continued strong relationship as its leadership team \n      directs the company\u2019s focus on its most productive areas.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Armstrong continued: \u201cAs a midstream service provider, we best serve our \n      shareholders and our upstream partners by supporting the economics of \n      key production areas. These conditional agreements will help re-position \n      the Barnett as a competitive basin for our new Barnett producer customer \n      as current drilling and completion technologies are implemented.\u201d\n     \n     \n      On a pro-forma basis, such agreements would reduce the percentage of \n      Williams Partners\u2019 revenues derived from Chesapeake to 15 percent as \n      measured by the first half of 2016 revenues and estimated MVCs. \n      Additionally, such agreements, which will be entered into by \n      subsidiaries of Williams Partners, L.P. (NYSE: WPZ), are expected to \n      reduce customer concentration risk and result in additional drilling and \n      volumes in the basins. The $820 million of up-front cash that will be \n      paid to Williams Partners upon execution of the agreements will be used \n      to reduce revolver borrowings. The cash proceeds will be treated as \n      deferred revenue for accounting purposes, with a majority to be \n      amortized into income over the 3 \u00bd-year period beginning in 2016 through \n      June 30, 2019, which coincides with the original MVC term.\n     \n     \n       Barnett Agreements \n     \n     \n      The conditional Barnett agreements provide accelerated upfront cash \n      payments to Williams Partners totaling $754 million, as well as new \n      terms and conditions under which Williams Partners will provide gas \n      gathering services to a new Barnett producer customer (Chesapeake\u2019s \n      successor in the Barnett) through 2029.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners expects the combination of $754 million in up-front \n      cash proceeds and the on-going cash flows generated by gathering \n      services provided to the new Barnett producer customer, to represent \n      equivalent net present value of cash flows as compared to Williams \n      Partners\u2019 expectations of Chesapeake\u2019s performance under the existing \n      agreement. Cumulative undiscounted cash flows for the years 2016-2019 \n      are expected to be approximately $240 million lower, and higher \n      thereafter, as a result of the conditional agreement.\n     \n     \n      By eliminating Chesapeake\u2019s MVC payments and establishing monthly \n      gathering rates at a percentage of NYMEX Henry Hub settlement prices \n      through the end of 2029, the conditional gas gathering agreement will \n      bring drilling back to the Barnett Shale and return wells determined to \n      be uneconomic under earlier gathering rates to production. The Barnett \n      gathering area is expected, therefore, to realize additional drilling \n      and improved volumes, enhancing Williams Partners\u2019 long-term competitive \n      position. Importantly, the new Barnett producer customer will commit to \n      an annual $40 million drilling commitment through 2018, as well as a \n      commitment to fund all incremental well connects and growth capital.\n     \n     \n      It is expected that Williams Partners\u2019 existing gathering agreement \n      including MVC obligations with a third-party producer, who has a 22 \n      percent working interest in the Barnett production, will remain \n      unchanged through mid-2019 and then may be adjusted thereafter.\n     \n     \n       Mid-Continent Region Agreement \n     \n     \n      The revised Mid-Continent agreement will provide an accelerated up-front \n      $66 million cash payment to Williams Partners from Chesapeake and \n      simplify several contractual requirements, allowing both Chesapeake and \n      Williams Partners to optimize their respective operations and asset \n      portfolio mixes.\n     \n     \n       Previous Renegotiations with Chesapeake \n     \n     \n      In September 2015, Williams Partners and Chesapeake announced an \n      expansion of gas gathering services for Chesapeake Energy in growing dry \n      gas production areas of the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio and a \n      consolidation of contracts in the Haynesville Shale in northwestern \n      Louisiana to optimize production opportunities, streamline fee \n      structures and restructure commitments to incentivize long-term \n      development of the fields. The companies also announced a new contract \n      for the Haynesville area. The  news \n      release  announcing the 2015 agreements can be found on our website.\n     \n     \n      "},

(NYSE: WMB) (\u201cWilliams\u201d) today confirmed \n      that Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) (\u201cETE\u201d) has provided \n      notice that it is attempting to terminate the Merger Agreement based on \n      an alleged failure to satisfy the closing condition requiring delivery \n      of a Section 721(a) tax opinion from Latham & Watkins LLP.\n     \n     \n      Williams issued the following statement:\n     \n     \n      Williams does not believe ETE had a right to terminate the Merger \n      Agreement because ETE breached the Merger Agreement by (among other \n      reasons) failing to cooperate and use necessary efforts to satisfy the \n      conditions to closing, including delivery of Latham & Watkins LLP\u2019s \n      Section 721(a) tax opinion. Accordingly, on June 27, 2016, Williams \n      filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court in connection with the \n      Delaware Court of Chancery's June 24, 2016 ruling relating to the Merger \n      Agreement between Williams and ETE.\n     \n     \n      Williams recognizes the practical fact that ETE has refused to close the \n      merger. Williams has concluded that it is in the best interests of its \n      stockholders to seek, among other remedies, monetary damages from ETE \n      for its breaches. So, while taking appropriate actions to enforce its \n      rights and deliver benefits of the Merger Agreement to its stockholders, \n      Williams will renew its focus on connecting the best natural gas \n      supplies to the best markets.\n     \n     \n      Williams remains well-positioned to meet the rapidly growing demand for \n      natural gas and experience significant fee-based growth. Williams\u2019 focus \n      on fee-based revenue has produced strong cash flow, and looking forward, \n      Williams expects continued growth from its portfolio of large scale \n      demand driven projects and a fully contracted natural gas transmission \n      business coming on in the balance of 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n     \n     \n      As previously announced, Williams stockholders voted to approve the \n      previously announced Merger Agreement with ETE and the transactions \n      contemplated thereby, including the merger of Williams into Energy \n      Transfer Corp LP (\u201cETC\u201d), an affiliate of ETE. The Merger Agreement was \n      announced on September 28, 2015 and the final voting results were \n      disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n       Williams (NYSE: WMB)  is a premier provider of large-scale \n      infrastructure connecting North American natural gas and natural gas \n      products to growing demand for cleaner fuel and feedstocks. \n      Headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., Williams owns approximately 60 percent of \n      Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) (\u201cWPZ\u201d), including all of the 2 \n      percent general-partner interest. WPZ is an industry-leading, large-cap \n      master limited partnership with operations across the natural gas value \n      chain from gathering, processing and interstate transportation of \n      natural gas and natural gas liquids to petchem production of ethylene, \n      propylene and other olefins. With major positions in top U.S. supply \n      basins and also in Canada, WPZ owns and operates more than 33,000 miles \n      of pipelines system wide \u2013 including the nation\u2019s largest volume and \n      fastest growing pipeline \u2013 providing natural gas for clean-power \n      generation, heating and industrial use.

Proportional adjusted EBITDA from equity investments increased \n      $45 million due primarily to contributions from Discovery\u2019s Keathley \n      Canyon Connector project in the Atlantic-Gulf operating area. Lower NGL \n      margins were mostly offset by reduced operating costs.\n     \n     \n      Commodity margins totaled approximately $103 million, up $53 million due \n      primarily to higher olefins margins from a full quarter of production at \n      Geismar, partially offset by lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported unaudited first quarter 2016 net income \n      attributable to controlling interests of $50 million compared with $89 \n      million in first quarter 2015. The decrease is primarily due to \n      impairments of certain equity-method investments and higher interest \n      expense, partially offset by higher olefins margins from the Geismar \n      plant and contributions from projects placed in service.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions \n     \n     \n      For first quarter 2016, Williams Partners generated $739 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $646 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      in first quarter 2015.\n     \n     \n      The $93 million increase in DCF for the quarter was driven by the $143 \n      million net increase in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash \n      interest expense of $37 million. Consistent with prior years, \n      maintenance capital expenditures were seasonably lower for the first \n      quarter versus expectations for the remaining quarters of the year.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategy to connect North America\u2019s abundant natural gas supply to \n      the best markets continues to deliver results and gain momentum as we \n      capture increasing opportunities on the demand side. This marks the \n      fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA in excess of $1 billion. \n      Our focus on fee-based revenues has allowed us to produce strong cash \n      flow growth despite a 16-year low in NGL prices.\n     \n     \n      \u201cTo help offset the effects of low commodity prices and slower near-term \n      growth among producers, we continue to aggressively manage our costs and \n      we made additional cost cutting decisions at the end of the first \n      quarter, including reducing our workforce by 10 percent.\n     \n     \n      \u201cImportantly this year, we won new business in the Gulf of Mexico, \n      started receiving fee-based revenues from Williams\u2019 new offgas plant in \n      Canada and achieved significant milestones on a number of demand-driven \n      natural gas projects. For the balance of 2016, we expect additional cash \n      flow from recently completed expansions and new projects coming into \n      service in the second and third quarters. Our fully contracted natural \n      gas transmission business coming on in 2017 and 2018 will drive growth \n      in the supply basins we serve.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Williams Partners \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           1Q Adjusted EBITDA \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           2016 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           2015 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Atlantic-Gulf\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          399\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          335\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Central\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          226\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          218\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          NGL & Petchem Services\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          57\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          7\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Northeast G&P\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          219\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          196\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          West\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          159\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          162\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Other\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           - \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           (1 \n         \n         \n           ) \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Total\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $ \n         \n         \n           1,060 \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $ \n         \n         \n           917 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Schedules reconciling adjusted EBITDA to modified EBITDA and net \n          income are attached to this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Effective January 1, 2016, businesses located in the Marcellus \n          and Utica shale plays within the former Access Midstream segment are \n          now managed, and thus presented, within the Northeast G&P segment. \n          The remaining Access Midstream businesses are now presented as the \n          Central segment. As a result, beginning with the reporting of first \n          quarter 2016, our operations are organized into the following \n          reportable segments: Central, Northeast G&P, Atlantic-Gulf, West, \n          and NGL & Petchem Services. Prior period segment disclosures have \n          been recast for these segment changes. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a \n      41-percent interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline \n      development project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment \n      also includes the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and \n      processing and crude oil production handling and transportation in the \n      Gulf Coast region. These operations include a 51-percent consolidated \n      interest in Gulfstar One, a 50-percent equity-method interest in \n      Gulfstream and a 60-percent equity-method interest in the Discovery \n      pipeline and processing system.\n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $399 million for first quarter \n      2016, compared with $335 million for first quarter 2015.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased primarily due to $28 million \n      higher proportional EBITDA from Discovery due to contributions from \n      Keathley Canyon Connector and $28 million higher fee-based revenues \n      primarily from higher transportation fee-based revenues on Transco \n      associated with expansion projects.\n     \n     \n       Central \n     \n     \n      The Central operating area includes operations that were previously part \n      of the former Access Midstream segment located in Louisiana, Texas, \n      Arkansas and Oklahoma. These operations became the Central operating \n      area effective January 1, 2016 and prior period segment disclosures have \n      been recast for this change. Central provides gathering, treating and \n      compression services to producers under long-term, fee-based contracts. \n      The segment also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the \n      Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region.\n     \n     \n      Central reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for first quarter 2016, \n      compared with $218 million for first quarter 2015. The increase in \n      adjusted EBITDA between years was driven primarily by higher gathering \n      fees in the Haynesville area.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services includes an 88.5 percent interest in an olefins \n      production facility in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade \n      propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment \n      also includes midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil \n      sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 261 miles of NGL and \n      olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility at Redwater. \n      This segment also includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities \n      marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near \n      Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent equity-method interest in Overland Pass \n      Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for first \n      quarter 2016, compared with $7 million for first quarter 2015.\n     \n     \n      The increase in first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to \n      $60 million higher olefins margins at the Geismar plant reflecting a \n      full quarter of production, compared to intermittent production in first \n      quarter 2015. The Geismar plant was off-line for most of first quarter \n      2015 and resumed consistent operations in late March 2015. Additionally, \n      the change in adjusted EBITDA included $16 million in unfavorable \n      changes in foreign currency exchange gains and losses.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P now includes the Marcellus South, Bradford and Utica \n      midstream gathering and processing operations that were previously \n      within the former Access Midstream segment. These operations became part \n      of Northeast G&P effective January 1, 2016 and prior period segment \n      disclosures have been recast for this change.

Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified \n      EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The decrease is primarily due to higher interest \n      expense and a lower allocation of net income to Williams associated with \n      an IDR waiver from the termination of the Williams Partners merger \n      agreement. Higher olefins margins from the Geismar plant and higher \n      equity earnings from Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector partially \n      offset the decrease.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited first quarter 2016 net loss attributable to \n      Williams of $65 million, or $(0.09) per share, compared with net income \n      of $70 million, or $0.09 per share on a diluted basis, for first quarter \n      2015. The unfavorable change in net income was driven primarily by the \n      items noted previously, as well as $112 million of pre-tax impairment \n      charges associated with certain equity-method investments and $34 \n      million in project development expenses in first quarter 2016 related to \n      the propane dehydrogenation project in Canada.\n     \n     \n       CEO Comment \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategy to connect North America\u2019s abundant natural gas supply to \n      the best markets continues to deliver results and gain momentum as we \n      capture increasing opportunities on the demand side. This marks the \n      fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA in excess of $1 billion. \n      Our focus on fee-based revenues has allowed us to produce strong cash \n      flow growth despite a 16-year low in NGL prices.\n     \n     \n      \u201cTo help offset the effects of low commodity prices and slower near-term \n      growth among producers, we continue to aggressively manage our costs and \n      we made additional cost cutting decisions at the end of the first \n      quarter, including reducing our workforce by 10 percent.\n     \n     \n      \u201cImportantly this year, we won new business in the Gulf of Mexico, \n      placed into service our second offgas plant in Canada and achieved \n      significant milestones on a number of demand-driven natural gas \n      projects.

The increase was driven by $60 million in higher olefins margins \n      from a full quarter of Geismar plant production and $63 million in \n      fee-based revenue growth. Proportional adjusted EBITDA from equity \n      investments increased $45 million due primarily to contributions from \n      Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector project in the Atlantic-Gulf \n      operating area. Lower NGL margins were mostly offset by lower operating \n      costs.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for first quarter 2016 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Proposed Merger of Energy Transfer Equity and Williams \n     \n     \n      The Williams Board is unanimously committed to enforcing its rights \n      under the merger agreement entered into with ETE on September 28, 2015 \n      and to delivering the benefits of the merger agreement to Williams\u2019 \n      stockholders.

A limited number of \n      phone lines will be available at (800) 344-6698. International callers \n      should dial (785) 830-7979. The conference ID is 9742588.\n     \n     \n      A link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast in both \n      streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be available following \n      the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per share, cash \n      available for dividends, and dividend coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP \n      financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity \n      investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and \n      accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for \n      nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share \n      (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method \n      investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      Cash available for dividends is defined as cash received from our \n      ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by the Williams NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends \n      relative to actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for \n      dividends are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are \n      they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from \n      operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes \n      for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States \n      generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

Transco plans to \n      place the project into service for the 2019/2020 winter heating season.\n     \n     \n      The Northeast Supply Enhancement project is being designed to provide \n      400,000 dekatherms per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity \n      from Transco\u2019s Compressor Station 195 in York County, Pa., to the \n      Rockaway Transfer Point, an existing interconnection between the Lower \n      New York Bay Lateral and the Rockaway Delivery Lateral in offshore New \n      York.\n     \n     \n      Prior to commencement of the open season, Williams executed precedent \n      agreements with subsidiaries of National Grid \u2013 the largest distributor \n      of natural gas in the northeastern U.S. \u2013 for firm transportation \n      service under the project. Once complete, the project will help meet the \n      growing natural gas demand in the Northeast, including the 1.8 million \n      customers served by National Grid in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and \n      Long Island.\n     \n     \n      \u201cCustomers and businesses in the local communities that we serve in New \n      York City and on Long Island benefit from affordable, clean and reliable \n      energy,\u201d said Ken Daly, President, National Grid New York. \u201cWilliams\u2019 \n      Northeast Supply Enhancement project expands on our commitment to \n      further improve reliability, make available much-needed gas capacity to \n      support job growth, and help reduce our carbon footprint.

(NYSE: WMB) (\u201cWilliams\u201d or \u201cWMB\u201d) today \n      announced that it has filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery \n      seeking a Declaratory Judgment and Injunction preventing Energy   Transfer \n      Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) (\u201cETE\u201d) from terminating or otherwise avoiding \n      its obligations under the Merger Agreement entered into with Williams on \n      September 28, 2015.\n     \n     \n      Specifically, the lawsuit asks the Court to prohibit ETE from relying on \n      either (i) any failure to close the transaction by the current \u201cOutside \n      Date\u201d of June 28, 2016 or (ii) any failure to obtain a Section\u00a0721(a) \n      tax opinion from Latham & Watkins LLP (ETE\u2019s outside counsel), as a \n      basis for ETE to avoid fulfilling its obligation to close the proposed \n      transactions with Williams. Williams alleges that ETE has breached the \n      Merger Agreement through a pattern of delay and obstruction designed to \n      allow ETE to avoid its contractual commitments. Williams believes that \n      the Merger Agreement prevents ETE from doing so.\n     \n     \n      The Williams Board is unanimously committed to enforcing Williams\u2019 \n      rights under the Merger Agreement entered into with ETE on September 28, \n      2015 and to delivering the benefits of the Merger Agreement to Williams\u2019 \n      stockholders.

The litigation against ETE in the \n      Delaware Court of Chancery seeks to unwind the private offering of \n      Series A Convertible Preferred Units. The Delaware Court of Chancery has \n      granted Williams\u2019 motion to expedite the litigation. The litigation \n      against Kelcy Warren in the district court of Dallas County, Texas, is \n      for tortious, or wrongful, interference with the Merger Agreement \n      executed on September 28, 2015 as a result of the private offering of \n      Series A Convertible Preferred Units.\n     \n     \n      Williams is committed to mailing the proxy statement, holding the \n      stockholder vote and closing the transaction as soon as possible.

The appeal was filed \n      with the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n      and contends, among other things, that the refusal is arbitrary and \n      capricious and constitutes an impermissible challenge to the Federal \n      Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s Certificate of Public Convenience and \n      Necessity which was issued to the company in December 2014.\n     \n     \n      Also today, the company filed an action with the U.S. District Court for \n      the Northern District of New York seeking a declaration that the State \n      of New York\u2019s authority to exercise permitting jurisdiction over certain \n      other environmental matters is preempted by federal law.\n     \n     \n      \u201cUpon its review of the evidence, we believe the court will agree that \n      this permit denial was arbitrary and unjustified and improperly relies \n      on the same failed arguments that the NYSDEC made during the FERC \n      certificate proceeding regarding the pipeline route and stream \n      crossings. The NYSDEC\u2019s allegation that it did not receive the necessary \n      information is inaccurate as demonstrated by extensive and comprehensive \n      technical materials submitted by Constitution for the record. We believe \n      this allegation was intended to distract stakeholders from the \n      application of a fair technical and regulatory review of the merits of \n      Constitution\u2019s application for a water quality certification.

(NYSE: ETE) (\u201cETE\u201d) challenging the private \n      offering of Series A Convertible Preferred Units that ETE disclosed on \n      March 9, 2016.\n     \n     \n      As previously announced, Williams commenced litigation against ETE and \n      Kelcy Warren in response to the private offering of Series A Convertible \n      Preferred Units that ETE disclosed on March 9, 2016. The litigation \n      against ETE in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeks to unwind the \n      private offering of Series A Convertible Preferred Units. The litigation \n      against Kelcy Warren in the district court of Dallas County, Texas, is \n      for tortious, or wrongful, interference with the merger agreement \n      executed on September 28, 2015 as a result of the private offering of \n      Series A Convertible Preferred Units.\n     \n     \n      The Williams Board is unanimously committed to enforcing its rights \n      under the merger agreement entered into with ETE on September 28, 2015 \n      and to delivering the benefits of the merger agreement to Williams\u2019 \n      stockholders. Williams is committed to mailing the proxy statement, \n      holding the stockholder vote and closing the transaction as soon as \n      possible. Williams remains committed to working with ETE to ensure the \n      financial strength of the combined company, and believes that all ETE \n      and Williams investors must be treated fairly and equitably. Williams \n      looks forward to completing the transaction and delivering its benefits \n      to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\n     \n     \n      The Williams Board has not changed its recommendation \"FOR\" the merger \n      agreement executed on September 28, 2015. In addition to the receipt of \n      Williams\u2019 stockholder approval, the transaction remains subject to other \n      customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway. The \n      transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.\n     \n     \n       Williams (NYSE: WMB)  is a premier provider of large-scale \n      infrastructure connecting North American natural gas and natural gas \n      products to growing demand for cleaner fuel and feedstocks. \n      Headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., Williams owns approximately 60 percent of \n      Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ), including all of the 2 percent \n      general-partner interest. Williams Partners is an industry-leading, \n      large-cap master limited partnership with operations across the natural \n      gas value chain from gathering, processing and interstate transportation \n      of natural gas and natural gas liquids to petchem production of \n      ethylene, propylene and other olefins. With major positions in top U.S. \n      supply basins and also in Canada, Williams Partners owns and operates \n      more than 33,000 miles of pipelines system wide \u2013 including the nation\u2019s \n      largest volume and fastest growing pipeline \u2013 providing natural gas for \n      clean-power generation, heating and industrial use. Williams Partners\u2019 \n      operations touch approximately 30 percent of U.S. natural gas.\n     \n     \n       Forward-looking Statements \n     \n     \n      This communication may contain forward-looking statements.\u00a0These \n      forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements \n      regarding the merger of ETE and Williams, the expected future \n      performance of the combined company (including expected results of \n      operations and financial guidance), and the combined company's future \n      financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans. \n      Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of the words \n      \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \n      \"would,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"potential,\" \"target,\" \n      \"opportunity,\" \"designed,\" \"create,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \n      \"ongoing,\" \"increases\" or \"continue\" and variations or similar \n      expressions.

{"Date": "04/25/2016", "Header": "Constitution Pipeline Committed to Building Federally Approved Pipeline, Delivering Energy Savings and Environmental Benefits to Northeast U.S.", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/constitution-pipeline-committed-building-federally-approved-pipeline-deliveri", "Textbody": "\n     ALBANY, N.Y.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC announced today that it remains \n      steadfastly committed to pursuing the federally-approved energy \n      infrastructure project, despite the recent decision by the New York \n      State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to deny the \n      Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the Constitution Pipeline \n      Project.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn spite of NYSDEC\u2019s unprecedented decision, we remain absolutely \n      committed to building this important energy infrastructure project, \n      which will create an important connection between consumers and reliable \n      supplies of clean, affordable natural gas. We believe NYSDEC\u2019s stated \n      rationale for the denial includes flagrant misstatements and inaccurate \n      allegations, and appears to be driven more by New York State politics \n      than by environmental science,\u201d the project sponsors said in a joint \n      statement.\n     \n     \n      Constitution Pipeline worked closely with NYSDEC staff for more than \n      three years to ensure that water quality measures are met before, during \n      and after construction. As a result of that dialogue, Constitution \n      Pipeline voluntarily agreed to the agency\u2019s requests to incorporate \n      re-routes, adopt trenchless construction methodologies, commit to \n      site-specific trout stream restoration and agreed to fund approximately \n      $18 million for wetland mitigation and banking and approximately $8.6 \n      million for the restoration and preservation of migratory bird habitats.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe worked in good faith with the NYSDEC for years, so this decision \n      comes as a surprise and is contrary to our dialogue and collaborative \n      effort to address concerns. The FERC-certificated route was developed \n      after extensive environmental and engineering analysis, which included a \n      comprehensive review of route alternatives. In its Final Environmental \n      Impact Statement, the FERC concluded that environmental impacts \n      associated with these alternatives were significantly greater than the \n      preferred route. Despite this, in the spirit of collaboration we \n      followed NYSDEC guidance and further altered our preferred route to \n      adopt NYSDEC staff recommendations.\u201d\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe were informed by the NYSDEC that the agency had everything it needed \n      to process the water quality certification. This point was further \n      emphasized when the agency issued a notice on Dec. 24, 2014, indicating \n      that the application was indeed administratively complete.\u201d\n     \n     \n      \u201cContrary to NYSDEC statements, the company was not informed of any \n      outstanding issues that it had not agreed to address as a condition of \n      the permit. In fact, during the past nine months, weekly inquiries were \n      made to the department to ensure no additional data was needed. Those \n      inquiries were either ignored or responded to in the negative. It is \n      obvious that the NYSDEC deliberately chose to remain silent to bolster \n      the political campaign of the State.\u201d\n     \n     \n      In addition, NYSDEC\u2019s claims regarding Constitution Pipeline\u2019s knowledge \n      of landowner tree felling activity are completely inaccurate and \n      contradict the third party environmental monitors working on behalf of \n      FERC. The federal monitors confirmed that Constitution was not a party \n      to the tree felling, and their Environmental Compliance Monitoring \n      Report has been available since March 18, 2016, to both NYSDEC and the \n      public at: ( http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?accession_num=20160318-4003 ).\n     \n     \n      The company also takes serious issue with claims that its application \n      lacked information related to stream crossings, depth of pipe, or \n      blasting.\n     \n     \n      The project sponsors continued, \u201cCompletely contrary to NYSDEC\u2019s \n      assertion, we provided detailed drawings and profiles for every stream \n      crossing in New York, including showing depth of pipe. In fact, all \n      stream crossings were fully vetted with the NYSDEC throughout the review \n      process. We are appalled with the comments that Constitution failed to \n      provide sufficient data to ensure every crossing was totally in \n      compliance with the NYSDEC guidelines.\u201d\n     \n     \n      \u201cConstitution Pipeline did not refuse to provide a comprehensive \n      analysis of pipe depth. Constitution committed to bury the pipe at least \n      five feet or deeper below the lowest bed elevation of the stream bed in \n      unconsolidated bedrock, which exceeds the federal regulations for pipe \n      depth. After weekly meetings and site visits with NYDEC, the company \n      also committed to conduct geo-technical borings and develop a \n      feasibility report which would be provided to the NYDEC after the permit \n      was issued for specific stream crossings which were identified by NYDEC.\u201d\n     \n     \n      The project sponsors will pursue all available options to challenge the \n      legality and appropriateness of New York's decision particularly since \n      it is based primarily on (a) comments previously made by New York to \n      FERC which FERC carefully considered before issuing its Certificate of \n      Public Convenience and Necessity for the Project; and (b) factually \n      inaccurate assumptions and assertions.\n     \n     \n      The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Dec. 2, 2014 issued \n      its certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Constitution \n      Pipeline. In its final environmental review of the proposed Constitution \n      Pipeline, FERC concluded that environmental impacts would be reduced to \n      \u201cless than significant levels\u201d with the implementation of proposed \n      mitigation measures by the company and recommendations by FERC.\n     \n     \n      Denial of the 401 Water Quality Certification by NYSDEC further delays \n      the potential for Constitution Pipeline to help facilitate local natural \n      gas service to homes and businesses in Southern New York, including the \n      installation of delivery taps along Constitution's proposed route to \n      facilitate local natural gas service by Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC \n      to homes and businesses in southern New York and northern Pennsylvania.\n     \n     \n      The permit denial will also delay about 2,400 direct and indirect jobs \n      that would be created during pipeline construction, generating $130 \n      million in labor income for the region. The decision could also cost \n      local governments approximately $13 million in annual property tax \n      revenue.\n     \n     \n      The 2015 New York State Energy Plan specifically recognized the role of \n      the Constitution Pipeline, projecting that natural gas usage will \n      increase during the next 15 years, and by 2030, natural gas will provide \n      the largest share of any single fuel source. Much of this additional \n      natural gas will be used to help generate electricity while also \n      enabling the state\u2019s adoption of more renewable energy sources.\n     \n     \n       Constitution Pipeline Company \n     \n     \n      Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC is owned by subsidiaries of  Williams \n      Partners L.P.

The new plant boosts domestic production \n      of petchem feedstocks and significantly reduces emissions in the oil \n      sands production process while recovering valuable natural gas liquids \n      (NGLs) and olefins.\n     \n\n\n\n     \n      Serving an upgrader facility north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the plant \n      is designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013 a greenhouse \n      gas \u2013 by an average of approximately 200,000 tonnes per year and reduce \n      emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) \u2013 a contributor to acid rain \u2013 by an \n      average of approximately 2,800 tonnes per year.\n     \n     \n      Williams is the only company extracting and fractionating NGL/olefin \n      mixes from oil sands upgrader offgas. Its first plant of this kind \n      serves the upgrader of another third-party oil sands producer. The two \n      plants recover ethane, propane, propylene and other liquids from the \n      upgraders\u2019 offgas streams. Williams then transports, fractionates and \n      markets the products.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis new offgas plant at the upgrader is helping the environment and \n      creating value from what was previously a low-value oil sands resource,\u201d \n      said David Chappell, president, Williams Energy Canada. \u201cIt adds to our \n      world-class, long-life complex of assets with a highly sustainable \n      competitive advantage in a key North American energy hub.\u201d\n     \n     \n      The plant increases by 60 percent the amount of NGLs produced by \n      Williams in Canada to a total of approximately 40,000 barrels per day. \n      At peak construction the project employed 1,200 workers and more than a \n      dozen permanent staff operate the facility.\n     \n     \n      Alberta\u2019s Minister of Environment and Parks, Shannon Phillips, who is \n      also Alberta\u2019s Minister Responsible for the Climate Change Office, \n      praised Williams for improving both the environment and the economy.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe applaud Williams Energy Canada for their efforts to reduce \n      greenhouse gas emissions, add value to our resources and create good \n      jobs here in Alberta,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cThe startup of this plant is a \n      testament to the innovation of Alberta\u2019s energy industry.\u201d\n     \n     \n      The Fort McKay First Nation, whose traditional land is nearby the new \n      facility, stated: \u201cThe Fort McKay First Nation appreciates that the \n      Williams facility is expected to have a positive impact on the local air \n      shed by reducing carbon and sulphur dioxide emissions. This will mean a \n      healthier future for our people and for the environment. We are pleased \n      to support companies that are putting the environment first and are \n      respectful of our traditional lands.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Following extraction at the upgrader, the NGL/olefins mixture will be \n      transported by Williams\u2019 recently extended Boreal Pipeline to Williams\u2019 \n      expanded Redwater Olefinic Fractionator (ROF), the only olefin/paraffin \n      fractionator in Canada. Most of the propane is expected to feed \n      Williams\u2019 planned propane dehydrogenation (PDH) facility near Edmonton \n      for the manufacturing of polymer-grade propylene. As previously \n      announced, a private equity global petrochemical group has executed a \n      long-term contract with Williams for 450 KTA of the propylene for \n      polypropylene production.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis developing complex will greatly reduce Canada\u2019s current dependence \n      on polypropylene imports while spurring domestic manufacturing and \n      strengthening the region\u2019s economy,\u201d said Chappell.\n     \n     \n       Pioneering Emissions Reductions \n     \n     \n      The offgas processing that Williams pioneered significantly reduces \n      emissions at its customers\u2019 oil sands production facilities. Williams \n      captures and processes a rich NGL/olefins mixture that would normally be \n      burned as fuel by the oil sands producer.

The reduction in 2016 capital and investment \n      expenditures reflects project deferrals, delays and cancellations \n      resulting from the current commodity price environment as well as \n      sharply higher costs of capital. On a GAAP-basis, including consolidated \n      joint ventures, planned growth capital has been reduced by $1.2 billion \n      to $2.1 billion.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategy remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our \n      business are strong despite the slower growth rates producers currently \n      face,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 general partner. \u201cWe continue to execute on critical \n      demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve the long-term natural \n      gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, \n      LNG and industrial sources. Our revised capital plan addresses the \n      realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest \n      in the growing demand side of our business.\u201d\n     \n     \n      The $2 billion growth capital funding needs include $1.3 billion for \n      Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most \n      of which are fully contracted with investment-grade customers. \n      Non-interstate pipeline growth capital funding needs total $700 million, \n      primarily reflecting relatively modest additional investments across the \n      partnership\u2019s gathering and processing systems. Capital spending for \n      gathering and processing in 2016 will be limited to known new producer \n      volumes, including wells drilled and completed awaiting connecting \n      infrastructure.\n     \n     \n      Dramatically reduced growth in production areas, combined with lower \n      commodity margins and a higher cost of capital, will drive both lower \n      capital and lower ongoing expenses that we expect to be significant.\n     \n     \n      Last week, Williams Partners announced that its Transco subsidiary \n      raised $1 billion of senior notes to fund capital expenditures. In \n      addition, WPZ plans to eliminate 2016 equity needs with planned asset \n      monetizations in excess of $1 billion during the first half of 2016. The \n      partnership does not plan to issue public equity or public debt in 2016. \n      The partnership anticipates its business plan will support its \n      investment-grade credit ratings. WPZ's liquidity totaled $2.984 billion \n      as of Friday, January 22, 2016.\n     \n     \n      In fourth quarter 2015, gathered volumes grew across the partnership\u2019s \n      natural gas gathering and processing operations in the Northeast and \n      remained stable in the West. The Geismar Olefins plant operated at \n      nearly 102 percent of its recently expanded operating capacity for the \n      fourth quarter. Williams Partners completed construction on Transco\u2019s \n      525 MDth/d Leidy Southeast expansion project, the Kodiak tieback to \n      Williams Partners\u2019 Devils Tower in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the \n      expansion of the Redwater fractionation facility associated with \n      Williams\u2019 Horizon Offgas liquid extraction plant in Canada.

The authorization is a \n      significant milestone and major step forward for the pipeline designed \n      to transport enough natural gas to serve approximately 3 million U.S. \n      homes.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe appreciate the FERC\u2019s prompt issuance of a limited 'Notice to \n      Proceed' for non-mechanized hand felling of trees in Pennsylvania,\u201d the \n      project sponsors said in a joint statement. \u201cAlthough the Commission has \n      not yet authorized tree felling in New York, we are optimistic that \n      authorization will come in order for the project to meet its 2016 \n      in-service commitment while complying with the environmental conditions \n      of the FERC Order and the USFWS Biological Opinion.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Approximately one-quarter of the trees planned to be felled are located \n      within Pennsylvania, while the remaining tress are located in New York. \n      Constitution Pipeline plans to begin limited tree felling activities in \n      Pennsylvania as soon as its contractors and crews can be trained and \n      deployed, finishing before March 31 to avoid adverse impacts to \n      migratory birds and the Northern long-eared bat. These activities will \n      be subject to third party environmental monitoring. In coordination with \n      state and federal agencies, Constitution Pipeline has agreed to \n      voluntarily provide $8.6 million in conservation funding for the \n      restoration and preservation of migratory bird habitats as a \n      conservation measure.\n     \n     \n      Assuming timely receipt of all remaining permits, in addition to a full \n      \u201cNotice to Proceed\u201d from FERC, Constitution Pipeline anticipates \n      beginning mainline construction in the spring of 2016 in order to help \n      meet growing natural gas demand in New York and New England during the \n      fourth quarter of 2016.\n     \n     \n      Last week in Afton, N.Y., more than 300 people, including landowners, \n      elected officials, business leaders, labor union members and community \n      leaders, rallied in support of the pipeline project, highlighting the \n      economic benefits the pipeline will deliver to New York. Construction of \n      the project is estimated to directly and indirectly support 2,400 jobs \n      and generate $130 million in labor income for the region. Once \n      operational, the pipeline\u2019s economic impact is anticipated to result in \n      more than $13 million in local tax revenue and more than $600,000 in new \n      income in the region.\n     \n     \n      In addition to serving markets in New England and New York City, \n      Constitution Pipeline and Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC have \n      announced plans to install four delivery taps along Constitution's \n      proposed route to facilitate local natural gas service to homes and \n      businesses in southern New York and northern Pennsylvania.\n     \n     \n      The Constitution Pipeline project involves the construction and \n      operation of approximately 125 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline from \n      natural gas supply areas in northeast Pennsylvania and connecting with \n      existing transmission pipelines in Schoharie County, N.Y. Once complete, \n      the pipeline will immediately become a key piece of natural gas pipeline \n      infrastructure in the Northeast, creating an important connection \n      between consumers and reliable supplies of clean, affordable natural \n      gas. Constitution will help address pipeline infrastructure issues that \n      have exposed New England and New York consumers to periods of high \n      natural gas prices and, significantly higher electric-generation costs. \n      Constitution will also provide opportunities to improve regional air \n      quality by using cleaner-burning natural gas in lieu of other fuels.\n     \n     \n       Constitution Pipeline Company \n     \n     \n      Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC is owned by subsidiaries of  Williams \n      Partners L.P.  (NYSE:WPZ),  Cabot \n      Oil & Gas Corporation  (NYSE:COG),  Piedmont \n      Natural Gas Company, Inc.  (NYSE:PNY), and  WGL \n      Holdings, Inc.  (NYSE:WGL). The 125-mile pipeline project is proposed \n      to connect domestic natural gas production in northeastern Pennsylvania \n      with northeastern markets during the fourth quarter of 2016.

certain other assets. Amounts for the \n          year-to-date 2014 period reflect a pre-tax remeasurement gain of \n          $2.5 billion related to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners \n          on July 1, 2014. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n      Williams reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted income from continuing \n      operations of $6 million, compared with $10 million, or $0.01 per share, \n      in fourth quarter 2014. For the year, Williams reported adjusted income \n      from continuing operations of $405 million, or $0.54 per share, compared \n      with $515 million, or $0.71 per share, for full-year 2014. The decrease \n      in adjusted income is due primarily to declines in NGL margins driven by \n      lower prices, higher depreciation expense due to significant projects \n      that were placed into service in 2014 and 2015, and increased net \n      interest expense. New fee revenue associated with certain growth \n      projects that were placed in service in 2014 and 2015 and olefins \n      margins from the Geismar plant\u2019s return to service partially offset \n      these decreases. The decrease for year-to-date period also reflects the \n      absence of $311 million of assumed business interruption insurance \n      proceeds in 2014 related to the 2013 incident at the Geismar plant.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited fourth quarter 2015 net loss attributable to \n      Williams of $701 million, or $0.94 per share, compared with net income \n      of $193 million, or $0.26 per share on a diluted basis, for 2014. The \n      decrease in net income was driven by $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairment \n      charges associated with goodwill, certain equity-method investments and \n      certain other assets.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams reported unaudited 2015 net loss attributable to \n      Williams of $557 million, or $0.74 per share, compared with net income \n      of $2.114 billion, or $2.92 per share on a diluted basis, for 2014. The \n      unfavorable change was primarily the result of the absence of a $2.544 \n      billion non-cash re-measurement gain in 2014 related to the \n      consolidation of our previous equity-method investment in Access \n      Midstream Partners as of July 1, 2014, as well as $2.6 billion of \n      pre-tax impairment charges in 2015 associated with certain equity-method \n      investments, goodwill and other certain assets. These items have been \n      adjusted out of the adjusted income from continuing operations measure \n      previously discussed. The unfavorable change also reflects declines in \n      NGL margins and higher operating, depreciation, general and \n      administrative, and interest expenses partially offset by increased \n      fee-based revenues and higher olefins margins.\n     \n     \n      The impairments were largely the result of significant declines in \n      energy commodity prices as well as the market values of WPZ and \n      comparable midstream companies\u2019 publicly traded equity securities in the \n      fourth quarter. The impaired equity-method investments and certain of \n      the impaired goodwill relate to the acquisition of Access Midstream \n      Partners completed in 2014. The remaining impaired goodwill was \n      associated with 2012 acquisitions.\n     \n     \n       CEO Comment \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWilliams Partners recorded another strong quarter, demonstrating \n      excellent operational performance and the resilience of our business to \n      grow despite sharply lower commodity prices. Even with reduced \n      activities in supply areas, the partnership enjoyed continued growth in \n      fee-based revenues primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions \n      brought into service.\n     \n     \n      \u201cSeveral Transco expansions, Gulfstar One, as well as the Keathley \n      Canyon Connector and the expanded Geismar plant, delivered significant \n      revenues in the second half of 2015. We expect new cash flow \n      contributions in the first quarter 2016 from our Leidy Southeast \n      Expansion, the Kodiak tieback and the expansion of our offgas processing \n      and fractionation business in Canada.\n     \n     \n      \u201cLow natural gas prices continue to spur demand-based growth on Transco \n      and our other interstate pipelines. As a result, our 2016 growth \n      investments are primarily focused on serving the long-term natural gas \n      needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG \n      and industrial loads.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and Other.\n     \n     \n      For periods prior to July 1, 2014, the Other segment includes Williams\u2019 \n      equity earnings from its 50-percent interest in privately held Access \n      Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an approximate 23-percent \n      limited-partner interest in Access Midstream Partners, L.P. As a result \n      of Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional ownership interests, periods \n      after July 1, 2014 include the consolidated results of Access Midstream \n      Partners.

\n          investment in Access Midstream in its Other segment. Following the \n          closing of the merger between Williams Partners and Access \n          Midstream, the consolidated results of Access Midstream for periods \n          after July 1, 2014, are reported as part of the Williams Partners \n          segment. Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of \n          projects in various stages of development, including the CNRL \n          Horizon offgas processing project in Canada as well as NGL and \n          petrochemical pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) today reported fourth quarter 2015 \n      adjusted EBITDA of $1.064 billion, a $215 million, or 25 percent, \n      increase from fourth quarter 2014. The increase was driven by $139 \n      million in fee-based revenue growth, $43 million in higher olefins \n      margins and $42 million in higher marketing margins. Proportional \n      adjusted EBITDA from equity investments increased $37 million. These \n      increases were partially offset by $45 million lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      For the year, the partnership reported 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $4.09 \n      billion, an $848 million, or 26 percent, increase from 2014. The \n      increase in 2015 adjusted EBITDA was driven by $1.376 billion, or 36 \n      percent, higher fee-based revenues and minimum volume commitments (MVCs) \n      compared with 2014. These higher fee-based revenues and MVCs include an \n      $837 million increase at Access Midstream primarily driven by \n      contributions from the full-year consolidation of Access Midstream for \n      periods following July 1, 2014. The remaining growth was driven by \n      fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One, Transco expansion projects placed \n      in service and higher volumes in the Northeast.\n     \n     \n      The Geismar olefins plant operated at expected production levels in the \n      second half of 2015 and contributed approximately $168 million of \n      olefins margins for the year. However, 2014 included approximately $311 \n      million in assumed business interruption insurance proceeds related to \n      the 2013 incident at the Geismar plant.\n     \n     \n      Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated equity \n      investments increased $301 million in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to \n      full-year contributions from Access Midstream joint ventures and \n      Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector project in the Atlantic-Gulf \n      operating area.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases in 2015 adjusted EBITDA were $229 \n      million in lower NGL margins due primarily to NGL prices that remain at \n      a 13-year low. NGL margins for 2015 totaled $160 million. Operating \n      expenses increased $370 million in 2015 due to a $219 million increase \n      at Access Midstream due to the consolidation of Access Midstream for \n      periods following July 1, 2014 and due to expansions at the \n      partnership\u2019s other operating areas. General and administrative expenses \n      decreased $11 million excluding a $78 million increase at Access \n      Midstream due to the consolidation for periods following July 1, 2014.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for fourth quarter and \n      full-year 2015 are provided in the earnings news release issued today by \n      Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Full-year 2014 includes Williams\u2019 proportional share of the adjusted \n      EBITDA from Williams\u2019 equity-method investment in Access Midstream, L.P. \n      As a result of Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional ownership interests, \n      periods after July 1, 2014 include the consolidated results of Access \n      Midstream Partners in the Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n       Update on Proposed Merger of Energy Transfer Equity and Williams \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the \n      transaction with Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.

The increase was driven by $139 \n      million in fee-based revenue growth, $43 million in higher olefins \n      margins from higher volumes and $42 million in higher marketing margins. \n      Proportional adjusted EBITDA from equity investments increased $37 \n      million.

The \n      increase in 2015 adjusted EBITDA was driven by $1.376 billion, or 36 \n      percent, higher fee-based revenues and minimum volume commitments (MVCs) \n      compared with 2014. These higher fee-based revenues and MVCs include an \n      $837 million increase at Access Midstream primarily driven by \n      contributions from the full-year consolidation of Access Midstream for \n      periods following July 1, 2014. The remaining growth was driven by \n      fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One, Transco expansion projects placed \n      in service and higher volumes in the Northeast.\n     \n     \n      The Geismar olefins plant operated at expected production levels in the \n      second half of 2015 and contributed approximately $168 million of \n      olefins margins for the year. However, 2014 included approximately $311 \n      million in assumed business interruption insurance proceeds related to \n      the 2013 incident at the Geismar plant.\n     \n     \n      Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated equity \n      investments increased $301 million in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to \n      full-year contributions from Access Midstream joint ventures and \n      Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector project in the Atlantic-Gulf \n      operating area.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases in 2015 adjusted EBITDA were $229 \n      million in lower NGL margins due primarily to NGL prices that remain at \n      a 13-year low. NGL margins for 2015 totaled $160 million. Operating \n      expenses increased $370 million in 2015 due to a $219 million increase \n      at Access Midstream due to the consolidation of Access Midstream for \n      periods following July 1, 2014 and due to expansions at the \n      partnership\u2019s other operating areas. General and administrative expenses \n      decreased $11 million excluding a $78 million increase at Access \n      Midstream due to the consolidation for periods following July 1, 2014.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported unaudited fourth quarter 2015 net loss \n      attributable to controlling interests of $1.605 billion compared with \n      net income of $382 million in fourth quarter 2014. The unfavorable \n      change was driven primarily by a $1.1 billion non-cash impairment of \n      goodwill and $859 million of non-cash impairments associated with \n      certain equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      The impairments were largely the result of significant declines in \n      energy commodity prices as well as market values of Williams Partners\u2019 \n      and comparable midstream companies\u2019 publicly traded equity securities in \n      the fourth quarter. The impaired equity-method investments and certain \n      of the impaired goodwill relate to the acquisition of Access Midstream \n      Partners completed in 2014. The remaining impaired goodwill was \n      associated with 2012 acquisitions.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Williams Partners reported unaudited net loss attributable \n      to controlling interests of $1.410 billion, compared with net income of \n      $1.188 billion for 2014. The unfavorable change was driven by a $1.1 \n      billion non-cash impairment of goodwill and $1.3 billion of impairments \n      associated with certain equity-method investments, as well as declines \n      in NGL margins and higher operating, depreciation and interest expenses. \n      Higher fee-based revenues and increased olefins margins partially offset \n      these unfavorable changes.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported $718 million in fourth quarter 2015 \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $266 million in fourth quarter 2014. For the year, the \n      partnership reported $2.819 billion in DCF, compared with $1.719 billion \n      for 2014. The primary drivers of the growth in DCF for both the quarter \n      and the year were the Access Midstream acquisition and other increases \n      in adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by higher interest \n      expense. DCF for 2014 reflects Williams Partners\u2019 results prior to the \n      merger with Access Midstream Partners, L.P.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWilliams Partners recorded another strong quarter, demonstrating \n      excellent operational performance and the resilience of our business to \n      grow despite sharply lower commodity prices. Even with reduced \n      activities in supply areas, the partnership enjoyed continued growth in \n      fee-based revenues primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions \n      brought into service.\n     \n     \n      \u201cSeveral Transco expansions, Gulfstar One, as well as the Keathley \n      Canyon Connector and the expanded Geismar plant, delivered significant \n      revenues in the second half of 2015. We expect new cash flow \n      contributions in the first quarter of 2016 from our Leidy Southeast \n      Expansion, the Kodiak tieback and the expansion of our offgas processing \n      and fractionation business in Canada.\n     \n     \n      \u201cLow natural gas prices continue to spur demand-based growth on Transco \n      and our other interstate pipelines. As a result, our 2016 growth \n      investments are primarily focused on serving the long-term natural gas \n      needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG \n      and industrial loads.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n       \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n

     \n       \n       \n         \n           (2) The first and second quarters of 2014 include $173 million \n          and $138 million, respectively, in assumed business interruption \n          insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at the Geismar plant. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Access Midstream Segment \n     \n     \n      Access Midstream provides gathering, treating, and compression services \n      to producers under long-term, fee-based contracts in Pennsylvania, West \n      Virginia, Ohio, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Access \n      Midstream also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the \n      Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region and a 62 \n      percent interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC, a joint project to \n      develop infrastructure for the gathering, processing and fractionation \n      of natural gas and NGLs in the Utica Shale play in Eastern Ohio. \n      Additionally, Access Midstream operates 100 percent of and owns an \n      approximate average 45 percent interest in multiple natural gas \n      gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region.\n     \n     \n      Access Midstream reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $351 \n      million, compared with $325 million in fourth quarter 2014. The increase \n      was driven by higher fee-based volumes, minimum volume commitments and \n      the increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint \n      venture.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Access Midstream reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.36 \n      billion, compared with $647 million previously reported for full-year \n      2014. Williams Partners' results for first and second quarter 2014 are \n      on a pre-merger basis and exclude Access Midstream.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf Segment \n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a \n      41-percent interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline \n      development project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment \n      also includes the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and \n      processing and crude oil production handling and transportation in the \n      Gulf Coast region. These operations include a 51-percent consolidated \n      interest in Gulfstar One, a 50-percent equity-method interest in \n      Gulfstream and a 60-percent equity-method interest in the Discovery \n      pipeline and processing system.\n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $390 \n      million, compared with $268 million for fourth quarter 2014. The \n      increase was due primarily to $88 million in higher fee-based revenues \n      from both Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects, as well as $35 \n      million higher proportional adjusted EBITDA primarily from Discovery \n      driven by the Keathley Canyon Connector project.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.528 billion, \n      compared with $1.075 billion for full-year 2014. The increase was due \n      primarily to $385 million in higher fee-based revenues from both \n      Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects, as well as $106 million \n      higher proportional adjusted EBITDA primarily from Discovery driven by \n      the Keathley Canyon Connector project, partially offset by lower NGL \n      margins.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services Segment \n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services includes an 88.5 percent interest in an olefins \n      production facility in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade \n      propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment \n      also includes midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil \n      sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 261 miles of NGL and \n      olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility at Redwater. \n      This segment also includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities \n      marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near \n      Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of \n      $72 million, compared with a loss of $13 million for fourth quarter \n      2014. Geismar operated at expected production levels and contributed \n      approximately $53 million of olefins margins for fourth quarter 2015. \n      Marketing margins increased $41 million for the quarter due primarily to \n      the absence of unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments, which \n      occurred in fourth quarter 2014. Partially offsetting these increases \n      were $27 million in lower commodity-related margins at the Canadian \n      operations.\n     \n     \n      For the year, NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of $197 \n      million, compared with $413 million for 2014. The Geismar olefins plant \n      operated at expected production levels in the second half of 2015 and \n      contributed approximately $168 million of olefins margins for the year. \n      However, 2014 included approximately $311 million in assumed business \n      interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at the \n      Geismar plant. In addition to the absence of the assumed business \n      interruption insurance proceeds, the year-over-year results were also \n      partially offset by $89 million in lower commodity-related margins at \n      the Canadian operations.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P Segment \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and \n      processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its \n      69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its \n      58.4-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II \n      owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $77 \n      million, compared with $78 million for fourth quarter 2014. The lack of \n      growth between fourth quarter 2015 and fourth quarter 2014 was primarily \n      due to lower fee-based volumes caused by price-related shut-ins by \n      producers.\n     \n     \n      For the year, Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $356 million, \n      compared with $276 million for full-year 2014. The improved results were \n      due primarily to a $96 million increase in fee-based revenues driven \n      primarily by higher volumes and incremental new service at Ohio Valley \n      Midstream as well as $23 million higher proportional EBITDA from equity \n      method investments. These gains were partially offset by $49 million in \n      higher operating expenses associated with growth and operational repairs \n      in the Northeast.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently negotiated a new gathering agreement with an \n      existing customer. The new agreement provides for a lower per-unit rate \n      but with expected higher revenue as a result of additional expected \n      production as well as additional acreage dedication and extended term. \n      Williams Partners expects no change in revenue associated with this new \n      agreement in 2016 and higher revenue in 2017 and beyond.\n     \n     \n       West Segment \n     \n     \n      West includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline interstate gas \n      pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and treating \n      operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area.\n     \n     \n      West reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $175 million, compared \n      with $190 million for fourth quarter 2014. Lower adjusted EBITDA for the \n      quarter was due primarily to $27 million lower NGL margins from lower \n      NGL prices that remain at 13-year lows.\n     \n     \n      For the year, West reported adjusted EBITDA of $648 million, compared \n      with $831 million for full-year 2014. Lower adjusted EBITDA for the \n      year-over-year period was due primarily to $150 million lower NGL \n      margins and $24 million higher expenses primarily driven by the addition \n      of the Niobrara operations from the Access Midstream merger. Higher \n      fee-based revenues from the addition of the Niobrara operations were \n      largely offset by decreases in other areas.\n     \n     \n       Year-End 2015 Materials to Be Posted Shortly; Conference Call \n      Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial materials \n      will be posted shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The information will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will jointly host a conference call and \n      live webcast on Thursday, Feb. 18, at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Once filed, the document will be \n      available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified \n      EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss).\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The special one-time dividend is in \n      addition to the regularly scheduled WMB dividends to be paid before \n      closing.\n     \n     \n      ETC will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax \n      purposes, and holders of ETC common shares will therefore receive an IRS \n      Form 1099, rather than a Schedule K-1, for federal income tax reporting. \n      As part of this transaction, in exchange for the contribution by ETC to \n      ETE of all of the assets and liabilities of WMB, ETE will issue to ETC a \n      number of ETE Class E common units equal to the number of ETC common \n      shares to be issued in the transaction. The Class E common units will be \n      entitled to receive the same quarterly cash distribution per unit as the \n      quarterly cash distribution per ETE common unit. As ETE has agreed to \n      provide all administrative services to ETC and to indemnify ETC for all \n      liabilities incurred by ETC, ETC is expected to distribute 100% of the \n      after-tax cash distributions it receives from ETE to holders of ETC \n      common shares on a quarterly basis as a cash dividend. ETC will benefit \n      from a dividend equalization agreement through calendar 2018 with ETE \n      that ensures that ETC shareholders will receive the identical cash \n      dividend as an ETE unit holder.\n     \n     \n      To address any uncertainty as to how the newly listed ETC common shares, \n      as a new security, will trade relative to ETE common units, ETE has \n      agreed that, as part of the merger consideration, each ETC share will \n      have attached to it one contingent consideration right (\u201cCCR\u201d). In the \n      event the ETC common shares trade at a discount to the ETE common units \n      on a daily volume-weighted average basis over the 23-month period \n      following the 20th trading day after the closing of the transaction, ETC \n      will make a one-time payment in an amount equal to such volume-weighted \n      price differential (the \u201cShortfall Amount\u201d). Any Shortfall Amount will \n      be settled in ETC common shares (at the then current value) or cash at \n      ETE\u2019s election, and ETE will issue a proportionate amount of Class E \n      common units to ETC. If ETC common shares trade at a premium to ETE \n      common units over the same 23-month period, the CCR will expire with no \n      value and a portion of the ETE Class E common units held by ETC will be \n      cancelled based on the volume weighted average price differential, \n      thereby reducing ETC\u2019s ownership interest in ETE. There is also an \n      automatic termination provision of the CCR if ETC trades above ETE on a \n      daily VWAP basis for 20 consecutive trading days and there is no \n      Shortfall Amount outstanding at the end of that 20 trading day period.\n     \n     \n      The transaction is expected to be tax-free to Williams\u2019 stockholders, \n      except with respect to any cash received. The parties believe that all \n      stakeholders will benefit from the cash flow diversification associated \n      with ownership in three large investment grade MLPs (Energy Transfer \n      Partners, L.P. (\u201cETP\u201d), Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (\u201cSXL\u201d) and WPZ). \n      As a result, the combination creates a truly unique and diversified \n      collection of compatible businesses that will drive greater near- and \n      long-term value.\n     \n     \n      Kelcy Warren, ETE\u2019s Chairman, said, \u201cI am excited that we have now \n      agreed to the terms of this merger with Williams. I believe that the \n      combination of Williams and ETE will create substantial value for both \n      companies\u2019 stakeholders that would not be realized otherwise.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Frank T. MacInnis, Chairman of the Williams Board of Directors, said, \n      \u201cAfter a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives, including \n      extensive discussions with numerous parties, the Williams Board of \n      Directors concluded that a merger with Energy Transfer Equity is in the \n      best interests of Williams\u2019 stockholders and all of our other \n      stakeholders. The merger provides Williams stockholders with compelling \n      value today as well as the opportunity to benefit from enhanced growth \n      projects.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams, said, \n      \u201cWilliams\u2019 intense focus on connecting the best natural gas supplies to \n      the best natural gas markets will be a significant complement to the ETE \n      family of diverse energy infrastructure. As a combined company, we will \n      have enhanced prospects for growth, be better able to connect our \n      customers to more diverse markets, and have more stability in an \n      environment of low commodity prices. Importantly, Williams Partners will \n      retain its current name and remain a publicly traded partnership \n      headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\u201d\n     \n     \n      During the course of its diligence process over the last ten weeks, the \n      Energy Transfer family has identified significant commercial synergies. \n      These synergies run across a broad spectrum, ranging from new revenue \n      opportunities, improved operational efficiencies and performance, new \n      capital opportunities and prioritization of existing capital projects. \n      ETE expects that the anticipated EBITDA from these commercial synergies \n      will exceed $2 billion per year by 2020 (or more than 20% of the \n      estimated current pro forma EBITDA for the combined company) and will \n      require overall incremental capital investment of more than $5 billion \n      to achieve.\n     \n     \n      As part of the merger, WPZ will retain its current name and remain a \n      publicly traded partnership headquartered with a meaningful ongoing \n      presence in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Also as a result of this announcement, WMB \n      and WPZ are withdrawing their financial guidance. ETE expects no impact \n      from this transaction on the credit ratings of ETP, SXL, Sunoco L.P. \n      (\u201cSUN\u201d) or WPZ.\n     \n     \n      ETE and Williams believe there are numerous meaningful benefits from a \n      proposed combination:\n     \n     \n       ETE Stakeholders \n     \n     \n       \n        At closing, the transaction will be immediately accretive to \n        distributable cash flow and distributions per unit for ETE and is \n        expected to be credit positive to ETE\u2019s credit ratings;\n       \n       \n        ETE\u2019s distribution growth rate is expected to remain at its current \n        level;\n       \n       \n        as a result of diligence, the size of both the expected cost savings \n        and the anticipated commercial synergies exceeds ETE\u2019s previous \n        expectations and will help ensure that the duration of ETE\u2019s \n        distribution growth rate will be longer as a result of the transaction;\n       \n       \n        the introduction of cash into the transaction consideration has \n        reduced the ETC share issuance by over 260 million shares (or \n        approximately 18.5% of the overall ETC share issuance);\n       \n       \n        the number of possible opportunities to migrate assets within the \n        Energy Transfer family and find additional commercial opportunities, \n        not currently quantified, within the expanded asset base will increase \n        significantly, thereby creating more value for ETP, SXL, WPZ and SUN, \n        which in turn will result in increased cash flow growth for ETE;\n       \n       \n        the ability of ETE to broaden its overall shareholder base through the \n        ETC structure; and\n       \n       \n        the creation of ETC will result in increased liquidity for ETE \n        unitholders because of the option for ETE unitholders to exchange ETE \n        common units for ETC common shares.\n       \n     \n     \n       WMB Stakeholders \n     \n     \n       \n        A compelling transaction that provides Williams\u2019 stockholders with:\n\n         \n           \n            an attractive premium to the implied trading price of WMB assuming \n            WMB traded in line with either the Alerian index or its midstream \n            peers since the date of ETE\u2019s initial offer;\n           \n           \n            a pro forma level of dividend per ETC common shares received that \n            will exceed the 2016 dividend per WMB share that Williams had \n            forecast on a pro forma basis for the Williams/WPZ merger;\n           \n           \n            ETC dividend growth superior to that of Williams on a pro forma \n            basis for the proposed Williams/WPZ merger;\n           \n         \n       \n       \n        the option to elect cash in the transaction will allow Williams\u2019 \n        stockholders to monetize, on a taxable basis, all or some of their \n        investment in WMB, subject only to the aggregate $6.05 billion pool of \n        cash consideration being fully utilized;\n       \n       \n        the exchange of WMB shares for ETC common shares is expected to be tax \n        free to WMB stockholders, except with respect to cash received;\n       \n       \n        for each outstanding ETC common share, ETC will receive from ETE the \n        same cash distribution per quarter as ETE distributes with respect to \n        each ETE common unit;\n       \n       \n        ETC will benefit from a dividend equalization agreement through \n        calendar 2018 that ensures that ETC shareholders will receive the \n        identical cash dividend as an ETE unitholder;\n       \n       \n        the CCR is intended to address any trading price differences between \n        ETC and ETE during the two-year period following closing;\n       \n       \n        ETE will become co-obligor of Williams\u2019 existing debt and Williams\u2019 \n        credit facility will be terminated at closing;

The \n      agreements with Chesapeake were entered into by subsidiaries of Williams \n      Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ), of which Williams own 60 percent, including \n      the general partner interest.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis demonstrates our commitment to working with Chesapeake to align \n      our interests on mutual growth while sustaining the financial support of \n      our investments,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of \n      Williams. \u201cThese new fee structures are designed to promote production \n      in the best locations across a wider footprint in these great basins, \n      which improves the economics on both the drilling and midstream side. \n      We\u2019ve also increased certainty around fees and volumes to support our \n      strategy of creating long-term, durable value for shareholders.\u201d\n     \n     \n      In the Utica, Williams and Chesapeake executed a long-term, fee-based \n      contract that gained a new area of dedication in the dry gas zone where \n      Chesapeake and others are targeting production growth. The agreement \n      extends the length of the Chesapeake acreage dedication to 2035, \n      increases the area of dedication by 50,000 acres from 140,000 acres to \n      190,000 net acres in a strategic area adjacent to Williams\u2019 existing \n      assets and converts the cost-of-service mechanism to a fixed-fee \n      structure with minimum volume commitments (MVCs). This change to a \n      fixed-fee contract enhances Williams\u2019 ability to gather third-party \n      volumes and build scale in Utica\u2019s dry gas areas. Williams expects this \n      will provide the opportunity to invest more than $600 million over five \n      years to install more than 200 miles of pipeline and related facilities \n      as this prolific area of the basin grows with up to 800 million cubic \n      feet per day of capacity to serve the development.\n     \n     \n      The companies also executed a new Haynesville contract that consolidates \n      the Springridge and Mansfield contracts into a single agreement with a \n      fixed-fee structure and a contract term to 2035. The consolidated \n      contract is supported by MVCs and a drilling commitment to turn 140 \n      equivalent wells online before the end of 2017. This commitment is \n      projected to result in significant production growth in the Haynesville \n      Shale asset over the next two years. The combined contract also better \n      aligns producer-midstream interests, simplifies contract administration, \n      optimizes development of the resource across both Springridge and \n      Mansfield areas and extends the Springridge dedication 15 years to 2035.\n     \n     \n      Williams expects positive impact to EBITDA in both the Utica and the \n      Haynesville areas due to near-term higher volumes and drilling \n      commitments.\n     \n     \n      "},

Financial \n          information for 2014 represents Williams Partners L.P. on a basis \n          that is prior to the merger with Access Midstream Partners, L.P. \n          Reconciliations to the most relevant measures included in GAAP are \n          attached to this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n      The increase in adjusted EBITDA in second quarter 2015 as described \n      above by segment was driven by $537 million, or 72 percent, higher \n      fee-based revenues and assumed minimum volume commitments compared with \n      second quarter 2014. Following the merger, the Access Midstream segment \n      contributed $391 million and Atlantic-Gulf and Northeast G&P improved \n      $104 million and $33 million, respectively. Excluding the Access \n      Midstream merger, Williams Partners second-quarter 2015 fee-based \n      revenue was up $130 million, or 17 percent. Geismar contributed \n      approximately $50 million of olefins margins in second quarter 2015. \n      Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated joint \n      ventures increased $121 million for second quarter 2015 versus second \n      quarter 2014, including $92 million from the addition of Access \n      Midstream\u2019s joint ventures and $33 million in Atlantic-Gulf as \n      Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector project ramped up.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $210 million higher operating \n      and general and administrative expenses versus second quarter 2014 \n      primarily as a result of the Access Midstream merger, the absence of \n      $138 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the \n      Geismar plant and $56 million in lower NGL margins due primarily to NGL \n      prices that are at a 10-year low.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.93 \n      billion, a $440 million, or 30 percent, increase from the same period \n      last year. The year-to-date increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven \n      primarily by the same factors that drove the quarterly results for \n      adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported unaudited second quarter 2015 net income \n      attributable to controlling interests of $300 million compared with $221 \n      million in second quarter 2014. The increase in second quarter net \n      income was due to new fee revenues from growth projects, including \n      Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects, increased insurance \n      recoveries associated with the Geismar incident and increased olefins \n      margins from the Geismar plant\u2019s return to service. These increases were \n      partially offset by increased operating expenses and depreciation, lower \n      NGL margins driven by lower prices and higher interest expense resulting \n      from new debt issuances.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015 net income was $389 million, compared with $573 \n      million year-to-date 2014. The year-to-date decrease in net income was \n      driven primarily by the same factors described above, except that \n      year-to-date Geismar insurance recoveries were lower in the current year.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions \n     \n     \n      For second quarter 2015, Williams Partners generated $701 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $504 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      in second quarter 2014. The $197 million increase in DCF for the quarter \n      was driven by the $291 million net increase in adjusted EBITDA, \n      partially offset by higher interest expense.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners generated $1.35 billion in DCF \n      attributable to partnership operations, compared with $1.09 billion in \n      DCF attributable to partnership operations for the same period last \n      year. The $261 million increase in DCF for the six-month period ended \n      June 30 was driven by the $440 million net increase in adjusted EBITDA, \n      partially offset by higher interest expense.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders. The cash \n      distribution is consistent with the partnership\u2019s prior distribution \n      guidance.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cSecond quarter results further demonstrate the benefits from our \n      clearly defined strategy of capitalizing on the significant natural gas \n      market growth by connecting the best supplies to the best markets. This \n      strategy has and will continue to deliver significant growth in our \n      fee-based revenues.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe large-scale infrastructure projects we recently placed into service \n      \u2013 including Transco expansions and Gulf of Mexico facilities \u2013 generated \n      significant fee-based revenues in the second quarter and we expect those \n      numbers to continue growing throughout 2015.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAs well, the Geismar plant ramped up in the second quarter and is now \n      online and consistently operating at or near its full production \n      capacity. We look forward to the significant contributions the plant \n      will make in the second half of the year.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n       \n

respectively, in assumed business interruption \n          insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at the Geismar plant. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Access Midstream \n     \n     \n      Access Midstream provides gathering, treating, and compression services \n      to producers under long term, fee-based contracts in Pennsylvania, West \n      Virginia, Ohio, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Access \n      Midstream also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the \n      Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region and a 62 \n      percent interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC, a joint project to \n      develop infrastructure for the gathering, processing and fractionation \n      of natural gas and NGLs in the Utica Shale play in Eastern Ohio. \n      Additionally, Access Midstream operates 100 percent of and owns an \n      approximate average 45 percent interest in 11 natural gas gathering \n      systems in the Marcellus Shale region.\n     \n     \n      Access Midstream reported adjusted EBITDA of $345 million for second \n      quarter 2015. Williams Partners\u2019 results for second quarter of 2014 are \n      on a pre-merger basis and exclude Access Midstream. For second quarter \n      2014, Access Midstream had previously reported $275 million of adjusted \n      EBITDA. The increase in adjusted EBITDA between years was driven by \n      higher fee-based volumes in the Utica and Haynesville areas as well as \n      the higher ownership in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Access Midstream reported adjusted EBITDA of $659 \n      million, compared with $525 million previously reported for the same \n      period last year. The year-to-date results were driven primarily by the \n      same factors that drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf \n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a \n      41-percent interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline \n      development project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment \n      also includes the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and \n      processing and crude production handling and transportation in the Gulf \n      Coast region. These operations include a 51-percent interest in Gulfstar \n      One, a 50-percent interest in Gulfstream and a 60-percent interest in \n      Discovery.\n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $389 million for second \n      quarter 2015, compared with $270 million for second quarter 2014. The \n      increase was due primarily to $104 million higher fee-based revenues \n      from both Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects, as well as $33 \n      million higher proportional adjusted EBITDA primarily from Discovery \n      driven by the Keathley Canyon Connector, partially offset by lower NGL \n      margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $724 \n      million, compared with $536 million for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date results were driven primarily by the same factors that \n      drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services \n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services includes an 88.5 percent interest in an olefins \n      production facility in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade \n      propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment \n      also includes midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil \n      sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 260 miles of NGL and \n      olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility and \n      butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater. This segment also \n      includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities marketing business, an NGL \n      fractionator and storage facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent \n      interest in Overland Pass Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of $33 million for \n      second quarter 2015, compared with $168 million for second quarter 2014. \n      Geismar contributed approximately $50 million of olefins margins for the \n      second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA included \n      $138 million of assumed business interruption insurance proceeds. \n      Additionally, second quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA included lower \n      commodity-related margins at the Canadian operations and higher \n      operating expenses related to the Geismar plant ramp-up.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of \n      $40 million, compared with $404 million for the same period last year. \n      Year-to-date 2014 results include $311 million in assumed business \n      interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at the \n      Geismar plant.\n     \n     \n      The Geismar plant ramped up in the second quarter of 2015 and the \n      expanded plant is now online.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and \n      processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its \n      69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its \n      58.4-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II \n      owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream. This segment is in \n      the early stages of developing large-scale energy infrastructure \n      solutions for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $92 million for second quarter \n      2015, compared with $76 million for second quarter 2014. The improved \n      results are due primarily to a $33 million increase in fee-based \n      revenues driven primarily by higher fee-based volumes and incremental \n      new services at Ohio Valley Midstream. Volumes at Susquehanna Supply Hub \n      were flat versus second quarter 2014 as a result of price-related \n      production curtailments in 2015.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $192 \n      million, compared with $130 million for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date results were driven primarily by the same factors that \n      drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      West includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline interstate gas \n      pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and treating \n      operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area.\n     \n     \n      West reported adjusted EBITDA of $150 million for second quarter 2015, \n      compared with $205 million for second quarter 2014. Lower adjusted \n      EBITDA for the quarter was due primarily to $31 million lower NGL \n      margins from lower NGL prices.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, West reported adjusted EBITDA of $312 million, \n      compared with $417 million for the same period last year. Lower adjusted \n      EBITDA for the year-to-date period was due primarily to nearly $80 \n      million lower product margins and $27 million higher operating and \n      maintenance expenses driven by the addition of the Niobrara operations \n      from the Access Midstream merger.\n     \n     \n       Proposed Acquisition of Williams Partners by Williams \n     \n     \n      As previously announced on May 13, 2015, Williams and Williams Partners \n      have signed a definitive agreement under which Williams will acquire all \n      of the public outstanding common units of Williams Partners in an all \n      stock-for-unit transaction at a 1.115 ratio of Williams common shares \n      per unit of Williams Partners. Subsequently, on June 21, 2015, Williams \n      publicly announced that it had received and rejected an unsolicited \n      proposal for Williams to be acquired in an all-equity transaction. The \n      unsolicited proposal was contingent on the termination of the proposed \n      acquisition of Williams Partners by Williams. Williams\u2019 board of \n      directors has authorized a process to explore a range of strategic \n      alternatives, which could include, among other things, a merger, a sale \n      of Williams, or continuing to pursue Williams\u2019 existing operating and \n      growth plan. Williams has indicated that it expects any shareholder vote \n      seeking approval of the proposed acquisition of Williams Partners by \n      Williams to occur after its ongoing review of strategic alternatives is \n      completed.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 guidance has been discontinued as a result of the \n      merger agreement between Williams and Williams Partners and Williams\u2019 \n      strategic alternatives process. Williams\u2019 guidance is provided in the \n      earnings news release issued today by Williams.\n     \n     \n       Second-Quarter Materials to be Posted Shortly, Live Webcast Scheduled \n      for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 second-quarter 2015 financial results will be posted \n      shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The information will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will jointly host a conference call and \n      live webcast on Thursday, July 30, at 9:30 a.m. EDT.

Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated \n      with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also \n      add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of \n      modified EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

        equity-method investments. The 2014 results include a $2.522 billion \n          pre-tax non-cash re-measurement gain related to the consolidation of \n          our previous equity-method investment in Access Midstream Partners \n          as of July 1, 2014. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n      Williams reported adjusted income from continuing operations of $167 \n      million, or $0.22 per share, in third quarter 2015, compared with $157 \n      million, or $0.21 per share, in third quarter 2014. The increase in \n      adjusted income for third quarter 2015 is due primarily to new fee \n      revenue associated with certain growth projects that were placed in \n      service in 2014 and 2015 and olefins margins from the Geismar plant\u2019s \n      return to service. These increases were partially offset by declines in \n      NGL margins driven by lower prices, as well as higher depreciation \n      expense due to significant projects that were placed into service in \n      2014 and 2015 and increased net interest expense.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams reported $399 million in adjusted income \n      from continuing operations, a $106 million decrease from the same period \n      last year. The decrease in year-to-date adjusted income was driven by \n      the absence of assumed Geismar business interruption proceeds in 2015, \n      as well as the same factors that drove the changes in quarterly adjusted \n      income.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited third quarter 2015 net loss attributable to \n      Williams of $40 million, or $0.05 per share on a diluted basis, compared \n      with third quarter 2014 net income of $1.678 billion, or $2.22 per share \n      on a diluted basis.\n     \n     \n      The unfavorable change was primarily the result of the absence of a \n      $2.522 billion pre-tax non-cash re-measurement gain in 2014 related to \n      the consolidation of our previous equity-method investment in Access \n      Midstream Partners as of July 1, 2014, as well as $477 million of \n      pre-tax impairment charges in 2015 associated with certain equity-method \n      investments. These items have been adjusted out of the adjusted income \n      from continuing operations measure previously discussed. The unfavorable \n      change also reflects declines in NGL margins and higher operating, \n      depreciation, general and administrative, and interest expenses \n      partially offset by increased fee-based revenues and higher olefins \n      margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams reported net income of $144 million, or \n      $0.19 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income of $1.921 \n      billion, or $2.68 per share, for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date decrease in net income was driven primarily by the same \n      factors described above.\n     \n     \n       CEO Comment \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strong third quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our \n      strategy to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets \n      with fee-based infrastructure, which accounted for more than 90 percent \n      of our gross margin. Williams Partners achieved record distributable \n      cash flow and delivered adjusted EBITDA growth across four of the \n      partnership\u2019s five operating areas.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn September, we completed Transco\u2019s Virginia Southside Expansion and \n      we\u2019re on track to place into full service the Leidy Southeast Expansion \n      by the end of the year, helping relieve supply bottlenecks in the \n      Northeast and creating more fee-based revenue.

Following the \n          closing of the merger between Williams Partners and Access \n          Midstream, the consolidated results of Access Midstream for periods \n          after July 1, 2014, are reported as part of the Williams Partners \n          segment. Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of \n          projects in various stages of development, including the CNRL \n          Horizon offgas processing project in Canada as well as NGL and \n          petrochemical pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported third quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 \n      billion, a $193 million, or 21 percent, increase from third quarter \n      2014. The increase in adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2015 was driven \n      by $204 million, or 18 percent, higher fee-based revenues. Olefins \n      margins increased $58 million reflecting full production at the expanded \n      Geismar plant in third quarter 2015 at multi-year low per unit ethylene \n      margins, partially offset by lower margins from our Canadian operations. \n      Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated equity \n      investments increased $52 million for third quarter 2015 versus third \n      quarter 2014, due primarily to Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector \n      project.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $68 million in lower NGL \n      margins due primarily to NGL prices that remain at 10-year lows, as well \n      as $51 million higher operating and general and administrative expenses \n      versus third quarter 2014 primarily reflecting higher costs associated \n      with our growing businesses.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $3.025 \n      billion, a $633 million, or 26 percent, increase from the same period \n      last year. The year-to-date increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven \n      primarily by consolidation of Access Midstream for all of 2015 versus \n      only the third quarter in 2014.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for third quarter 2015 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2014 includes $104 million for Williams\u2019 proportional share \n      of the adjusted EBITDA from Williams\u2019 equity-method investment in Access \n      Midstream, L.P. As a result of Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional \n      ownership interests, periods after July 1, 2014 include the consolidated \n      results of Access Midstream Partners in the Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n       Other \n     \n     \n      As announced on Sept. 28 in connection with the proposed business \n      combination transaction between Williams and Energy Transfer Equity, \n      L.P., Williams and Williams Partners withdrew previous financial \n      guidance and adopted a policy of no longer providing financial guidance.\n     \n     \n       Third-Quarter 2015 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&A Webcast \n      Scheduled for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 third-quarter 2015 financial results package will be posted \n      shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The package will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      The company and the partnership will host a conference call and live \n      webcast on Thursday, Oct. 29, at 9 a.m. EDT.

Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d), \n      adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as \n      defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, gain on remeasurement of equity \n      method investment, impairments of equity investments, depreciation and \n      amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset \n      retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our \n      proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified \n      EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor adjusted income from continuing operations \n      are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they \n      presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. \n      They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a \n      measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States \n      generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The \n      unsolicited proposal was contingent on the termination of Williams\u2019 \n      pending acquisition of Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ). With the \n      assistance of its outside financial and legal advisors, the Williams \n      Board carefully considered the unsolicited proposal and determined that \n      it significantly undervalues Williams and would not deliver value \n      commensurate with what Williams expects to achieve on a standalone basis \n      and through other growth initiatives, including the pending acquisition \n      of WPZ.\n     \n     \n      As previously announced on May 13, 2015, Williams and WPZ have signed a \n      definitive agreement under which Williams will acquire all of the public \n      outstanding common units of WPZ in an all stock-for-unit transaction at \n      a 1.115 ratio of Williams common shares per unit of WPZ. During its \n      strategic review process, Williams will continue to work towards the \n      completion of the WPZ transaction.\n     \n     \n      Williams has retained Barclays and Lazard to assist in its review of \n      strategic alternatives, which could include, among other things, a \n      merger, a sale of Williams or continuing to pursue the Company\u2019s \n      existing operating and growth plan.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur Board and management team remain committed to acting in the best \n      interests of shareholders, and in light of the unsolicited proposal, our \n      Board believes it is in the best interest of shareholders to conduct a \n      thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, \n      President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams. \u201cWilliams\u2019 premier \n      infrastructure connects the best natural gas supplies to the best \n      markets, and our strategy has provided substantial shareholder value \n      allowing us to deliver a compound annual dividend growth rate of \n      approximately 30% since we embarked on our strategy in 2012.

DCF and cash distribution coverage ratio \n          for the 2014 periods reflect amounts previously reported for \n          Williams Partners L.P. for those periods prior to the merger. \n          Reconciliations to the most relevant measures included in GAAP are \n          attached to this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           (2) Cash distribution coverage ratios for the third quarter and \n          year-to-date 2015 periods exclude the benefit of $209 million of IDR \n          waivers associated with the WPZ merger termination fee. The 2015 \n          cash distribution coverage ratios, including the benefit of the $209 \n          million IDR waiver during third quarter 2015, are 1.47x and 1.07x \n          for the third quarter and year-to-date 2015 periods, respectively. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n       \n         \n           (3) Amounts reported for the 2015 periods reflect impairment \n          charges totaling $477 million associated with certain equity-method \n          investments previously recorded at fair value in conjunction with \n          the Access merger. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n      The increase in adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2015 as described above \n      by segment was driven by $204 million, or 18 percent, higher fee-based \n      revenues and minimum volume commitments compared with third quarter \n      2014. Olefins margins increased $58 million reflecting production at the \n      expanded Geismar plant in third quarter 2015 at multi-year low per unit \n      ethylene margins, partially offset by lower margins from our Canadian \n      operations. Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated \n      equity investments increased $52 million for third quarter 2015 versus \n      third quarter 2014, due primarily to Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon \n      Connector project in the Atlantic-Gulf operating area.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $68 million in lower NGL \n      margins due primarily to NGL prices that remain at a 10-year low, as \n      well as $51 million higher operating and general and administrative \n      expenses versus third quarter 2014 primarily reflecting higher costs \n      associated with our growing businesses.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $3.025 \n      billion, a $633 million, or 26 percent, increase from the same period \n      last year. The year-to-date increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily \n      driven by contributions from the Access Midstream merger for periods \n      following July 1, 2014, as well as fee-based revenue growth in other \n      operating areas.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported unaudited third quarter 2015 net loss \n      attributable to controlling interests of $194 million compared with \n      income of $233 million in third quarter 2014. The unfavorable change was \n      driven by $477 million of impairments in 2015 associated with certain \n      equity-method investments, as well as declines in NGL margins and higher \n      operating, depreciation and interest expenses. The impairment charges \n      primarily relate to our investment in the Delaware basin gas gathering \n      system, which were driven by an increase in the discount rate utilized \n      in our estimation of the fair value of the investment at September 30, \n      2015. Higher fee-based revenues and increased olefins margins partially \n      offset these unfavorable changes.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date net income was $195 million, compared with $806 million \n      year-to-date 2014. The year-to-date decrease in net income was driven \n      primarily by the same factors described above, as well as higher general \n      and administrative costs.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions \n     \n     \n      For third quarter 2015, Williams Partners generated $754 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $367 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      in third quarter 2014. The $387 million increase in DCF for the quarter \n      was driven by the Access Midstream acquisition and other increases in \n      adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher interest expense. DCF for \n      2014 reflects pre-merger Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners generated $2.1 billion in DCF \n      attributable to partnership operations, compared with $1.45 billion in \n      DCF attributable to partnership operations for the same period last \n      year. The $648 million increase in DCF for the nine-month period ended \n      Sept. 30 was driven by the Access Midstream acquisition and other \n      increases in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher interest \n      expense.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strong third quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our \n      strategy to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets \n      with fee-based infrastructure, which accounted for more than 90 percent \n      of our gross margin. Williams Partners achieved record distributable \n      cash flow and delivered adjusted EBITDA growth across four of the \n      partnership\u2019s five operating areas.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn September, we completed Transco\u2019s Virginia Southside Expansion and \n      we\u2019re on track to place into full service the Leidy Southeast Expansion \n      by the end of the year, helping relieve supply bottlenecks in the \n      Northeast and creating more fee-based revenue. Supply development in the \n      Northeast will continue to be hampered until constraints are addressed. \n      Fortunately, Williams Partners and other industry participants are hard \n      at work implementing projects that will solve this problem.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe recognize the fundamental pressures impacting our direct commodity \n      margins and volume growth on our gathering and processing systems. \n      However, our unique position and backlog of fully contracted, \n      demand-driven projects will drive our continued operating cash flow \n      growth.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Williams Partners \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Adjusted EBITDA \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           3Q 2015 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           3Q 2014 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           YTD 2015 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           YTD 2014 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Access Midstream (1)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          351\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          322\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          1,010\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $\n         \n         \n          322\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Atlantic-Gulf\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          414\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          271\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          1,138\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          807\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          NGL & Petchem Services (2)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          85\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          22\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          125\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          426\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Northeast G&P\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          87\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          68\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          279\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          198\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          West\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          161\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          224\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          473\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          641\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Other\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           2 \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           -

Access \n      Midstream also includes a non-operated 50 percent interest in the \n      Delaware Basin gas gathering system in the Mid-Continent region and a 62 \n      percent interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC, a joint project to \n      develop infrastructure for the gathering, processing and fractionation \n      of natural gas and NGLs in the Utica Shale play in Eastern Ohio. \n      Additionally, Access Midstream operates 100 percent of and owns an \n      approximate average 45 percent interest in 11 natural gas gathering \n      systems in the Marcellus Shale region.\n     \n     \n      Access Midstream reported adjusted EBITDA of $351 million for third \n      quarter 2015, compared with $322 million of adjusted EBITDA in third \n      quarter 2014. The increase in adjusted EBITDA between years was driven \n      by higher fee-based volumes, minimum volume commitments and the \n      increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint \n      venture.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Access Midstream segment reported adjusted EBITDA of \n      $1.01 billion, compared with $322 million previously reported for the \n      same period last year. Williams Partners\u2019 results for first and second \n      quarter 2014 are on a pre-merger basis and exclude Access Midstream.\n     \n     \n       Atlantic-Gulf Segment \n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a \n      41-percent interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline \n      development project, which Williams Partners consolidates. The segment \n      also includes the partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and \n      processing and crude production handling and transportation in the Gulf \n      Coast region. These operations include a 51-percent interest in Gulfstar \n      One, a 50-percent interest in Gulfstream and a 60-percent interest in \n      the Discovery pipeline and processing system.\n     \n     \n      Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $414 million for third quarter \n      2015, compared with $271 million for third quarter 2014. The increase \n      was due primarily to $113 million higher fee-based revenues from both \n      Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects, as well as $35 million \n      higher proportional adjusted EBITDA primarily from Discovery driven by \n      the Keathley Canyon Connector project, partially offset by lower NGL \n      margins.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Atlantic-Gulf reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.14 \n      billion, compared with $807 million for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date results were driven primarily by the same factors that \n      drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       NGL & Petchem Services Segment \n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services includes an 88.5 percent interest in an olefins \n      production facility in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade \n      propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region. This segment \n      also includes midstream operations in Alberta, Canada, including an oil \n      sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 260 miles of NGL and \n      olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility and \n      butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater. This segment also \n      includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities marketing business, an NGL \n      fractionator and storage facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent \n      interest in Overland Pass Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of $85 million for third \n      quarter 2015, compared with $22 million for third quarter 2014. Geismar \n      operated at expected production levels and contributed approximately $71 \n      million of olefins margins for third quarter 2015, partially offset by \n      $19 million in lower commodity-related margins at the Canadian \n      operations.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of \n      $125 million, compared with $426 million for the same period last year. \n      Year-to-date 2014 results include approximately $311 million in assumed \n      business interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at \n      the Geismar plant. In addition to the absence of the assumed business \n      interruption insurance proceeds, the year-to-date results were also \n      driven by the same factors that drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P Segment \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and \n      processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its \n      69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its \n      58.4-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II \n      owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $87 million for third quarter \n      2015, compared with $68 million for third quarter 2014. The improved \n      results are due primarily to a $25 million increase in fee-based \n      revenues driven primarily by higher volumes and incremental new services \n      at Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as $11 million higher proportional \n      EBITDA from equity investments. These gains were partially offset by $15 \n      million in higher operating expenses associated with growth and \n      operational repairs in the Northeast.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $279 \n      million, compared with $198 million for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date results were driven primarily by the same factors that \n      drove the quarterly results.\n     \n     \n       West Segment \n     \n     \n      West includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline interstate gas \n      pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and treating \n      operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area.\n     \n     \n      West reported adjusted EBITDA of $161 million for third quarter 2015, \n      compared with $224 million for third quarter 2014. Lower adjusted EBITDA \n      for the quarter was due primarily to $52 million lower NGL margins from \n      lower NGL prices that remain at 10-year lows.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, West reported adjusted EBITDA of $473 million, \n      compared with $641 million for the same period last year. Lower adjusted \n      EBITDA for the year-to-date period was due primarily to nearly $123 \n      million lower NGL margins and $37 million higher operating and \n      maintenance expenses driven by the addition of the Niobrara operations \n      from the Access Midstream merger and various increases in other \n      operating expenses.\n     \n     \n       Other \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders. As announced \n      on Sept. 28 in connection with the proposed business combination \n      transaction between Williams and Energy Transfer Equity, L.P., Williams \n      and Williams Partners withdrew previous financial guidance and adopted a \n      policy of no longer providing financial guidance.\n     \n     \n       Third-Quarter Materials to be Posted Shortly, Live Webcast Scheduled \n      for Tomorrow \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 third-quarter 2015 financial results will be posted \n      shortly at  www.williams.com . \n      The information will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners and Williams will jointly host a conference call and \n      live webcast on Thursday, Oct. 29, at 9 a.m. EDT. A limited number of \n      phone lines will be available at (800) 505-9568. International callers \n      should dial (416) 505-9568. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of \n      the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be \n      available following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The partnership plans to file its third-quarter 2015 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      impairments of equity investments, depreciation and amortization \n      expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement \n      obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional \n      ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of \n      equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.

The decrease in \n      adjusted income for second quarter 2015 is due primarily to the absence \n      in 2015 of assumed Geismar business interruption proceeds, increased \n      interest expense associated with new debt issuances and higher \n      depreciation expense due to significant projects that were placed into \n      service in 2014 and 2015, as well as declines in NGL margins driven by \n      lower prices. These decreases were partially offset by new fee revenues \n      associated with certain growth projects that were placed in service in \n      2014 and 2015.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams reported $232 million in adjusted income \n      from continuing operations, a $116 million decrease from the same period \n      last year. The decrease in year-to-date adjusted income was driven by \n      the same factors that drove the decrease in quarterly adjusted income.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited second quarter 2015 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $114 million, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, \n      compared with second quarter 2014 net income of $103 million, or $0.15 \n      per share on a diluted basis. The $11 million increase in net income \n      attributable to Williams in second quarter 2015 was driven primarily by \n      new fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects \n      and increased insurance recoveries associated with the Geismar incident. \n      These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense \n      associated with new debt issuances, higher depreciation expense due to \n      significant projects that were placed in service in 2014 and 2015, as \n      well as declines in NGL margins driven by lower prices.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams reported net income of $184 million, or \n      $0.24 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income of $243 \n      million, or $0.35 per share, for the same period last year. The \n      year-to-date changes in net income were impacted by the same factors as \n      the quarterly period with the exception of year-to-date Geismar \n      insurance recoveries being lower in the current year and the absence of \n      equity losses in 2014 associated with the discontinuance of the \n      Bluegrass Pipeline project.\n     \n     \n       CEO Comment \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cSecond quarter results further demonstrate the benefits from our \n      clearly defined strategy of capitalizing on the significant natural gas \n      market growth by connecting the best supplies to the best markets. This \n      strategy has and will continue to deliver significant growth in our \n      fee-based revenues.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe large-scale infrastructure projects we recently placed into service \n      \u2013 including Transco expansions and Gulf of Mexico facilities \u2013 generated \n      significant fee-based revenues in the second quarter and we expect those \n      numbers to continue growing throughout 2015.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAs well, the Geismar plant ramped up in the second quarter and is now \n      online and consistently operating at or near its full production \n      capacity.

Following the \n            closing of the merger between Williams Partners and Access \n            Midstream, the consolidated results of Access Midstream are \n            reported as part of the Williams Partners segment. Williams NGL & \n            Petchem Services segment is comprised of projects in various \n            stages of development, including the CNRL Horizon offgas \n            processing project in Canada as well as NGL and petrochemical \n            pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. \n           \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported second quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 \n      billion, a $291 million, or 41 percent, increase from second quarter \n      2014. The increase in adjusted EBITDA in second quarter 2015 was driven \n      by $537 million, or 72 percent, higher fee-based revenues including \n      assumed minimum volume commitments compared with second quarter 2014. \n      This increase reflects the benefit of the Access Midstream acquisition \n      and new fee-based revenues from assets placed in service, including \n      Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects. Excluding the Access \n      Midstream acquisition, Williams Partners second-quarter 2015 fee-based \n      revenue was up $130 million, or 17 percent. Geismar contributed \n      approximately $50 million of olefins margins in second quarter 2015. \n      Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated joint \n      ventures increased $121 million for second quarter 2015 versus second \n      quarter 2014, including $92 million from the addition of Access \n      Midstream\u2019s joint ventures and $33 million driven by Discovery\u2019s \n      Keathley Canyon Connector project ramp up.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting these increases were $210 million higher operating \n      and general and administrative expenses versus second quarter 2014 \n      primarily as a result of the Access Midstream acquisition, the absence \n      of $138 million of assumed business interruption insurance proceeds \n      related to the Geismar plant and $56 million in lower NGL margins due \n      primarily to NGL prices that are at a 10-year low.\n     \n     \n      Year-to-date 2015, Williams Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.93 \n      billion, a $440 million, or 30 percent, increase from the same period \n      last year. The year-to-date increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven \n      primarily by the same factors that drove the quarterly results for \n      adjusted EBITDA.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for second quarter 2015 \n      are provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams \n      Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      The first and second quarters of 2014 include $51 million and $53 \n      million, respectively, for Williams\u2019 proportional share of the adjusted \n      EBITDA from Williams\u2019 equity-method investment in Access Midstream, L.P. \n      As a result of Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional ownership interests, \n      periods after July 1, 2014 include the consolidated results of Access \n      Midstream Partners. Furthermore, following the closing of the merger \n      between Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners in February \n      2015, the consolidated results of Access Midstream for periods following \n      July 1, 2014 are now reported as part of the Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n       Williams Strategic Alternatives Review \n     \n     \n      On June 21, 2015, Williams announced that it had received and \n      subsequently rejected an unsolicited proposal to be acquired in an \n      all-equity transaction contingent on the termination of Williams\u2019 \n      proposed acquisition of Williams Partners. Williams also announced that \n      its board of directors authorized a process to explore a range of \n      strategic alternatives, which could include, among other things, a \n      merger, a sale, or continuing to pursue its existing operating and \n      growth plan. The process is well underway. Depending on the outcome of \n      the board\u2019s review, Williams anticipates that any shareholder vote \n      seeking approval of the pending Williams Partners transaction would \n      occur after the process is completed.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      Williams reaffirmed its previously announced plans to increase its \n      third-quarter 2015 dividend to $0.64, or $2.56 on an annualized basis \n      and $2.85 in 2016, with annual dividend growth thereafter of \n      approximately 10 percent to 15 percent through 2020. Dividend guidance \n      assumes completion of Williams\u2019 acquisition of Williams Partners public \n      units as previously announced on May 13, 2015.\n     \n     \n      Williams is reaffirming adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016-2018. However, \n      Williams is lowering full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance by \n      approximately 6 percent to a midpoint of $4.23 billion, due primarily to \n      the effects of lower commodity

A limited number of \n      phone lines will be available at (888) 297-0360. International callers \n      should dial (719) 457-2603. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of \n      the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be \n      available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-Q \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its second quarter 2015 Form 10-Q with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release may include certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted \n      EBITDA, adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d), \n      adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends, dividend \n      coverage ratio, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage \n      ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules \n      of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income \n      tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method \n      investments, other net investing income, depreciation and amortization \n      expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement \n      obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional \n      ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of \n      equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      For Williams, cash available for dividends is defined as cash received \n      from its ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by its NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams\u2019 cash available for \n      dividends relative to its actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      For Williams Partners L.P., we define distributable cash flow as \n      adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of \n      interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and \n      cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation \n      and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the \n      comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital \n      expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our \n      proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      For Williams Partners L.P., we also calculate the ratio of distributable \n      cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow \n      relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio \n      calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance.

Financial information \n      for first quarter 2014 represents Williams Partners L.P. on a basis that \n      is prior to the merger with Access Midstream Partners, L.P. \n      Reconciliations to the most relevant measures included in GAAP are \n      attached to this news release. \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $917 \n      million, a $149 million, or 19 percent, increase from first quarter 2014.\n     \n     \n      The increase in adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2015 is due primarily \n      to the contribution of approximately $314 million of adjusted EBITDA \n      from Access Midstream as a result of the merger, $69 million higher \n      adjusted EBITDA for the Atlantic-Gulf, and $46 million higher adjusted \n      EBITDA from Northeast G&P. Partially offsetting these increases were a \n      $229 million decrease at NGL & Petchem Services due primarily to $173 \n      million of business interruption proceeds included in adjusted EBITDA in \n      2014 and a $50 million decrease in the West due to lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      The increase in adjusted EBITDA in first quarter 2015 was also driven by \n      $490 million, or 66 percent, higher fee-based revenues compared with \n      first quarter 2014. The merger with Access Midstream contributed $369 \n      million and Atlantic-Gulf and Northeast G&P improved $79 million and $43 \n      million, respectively. Excluding the Access Midstream merger, Williams \n      Partners first-quarter 2015 fee-based revenue was up $121 million, or 16 \n      percent. Additionally, the proportional EBITDA from non-consolidated \n      joint ventures increased $90 million for first quarter 2015 versus first \n      quarter 2014, primarily from the addition of Access Midstream\u2019s joint \n      ventures.\n     \n     \n      Partially offsetting the increases described above, were lower results \n      from Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant. The Geismar plant was off-line \n      for first quarter 2014; however, this period included $173 million of \n      business interruption insurance proceeds included in adjusted EBITDA in \n      2014. Additionally, first quarter 2015 included $162 million higher \n      operating and general and administrative expenses versus first quarter \n      2014 primarily as a result of the Access Midstream merger. Commodity \n      margins totaled $56 million, down $105 million due primarily to low NGL \n      prices.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported unaudited first quarter 2015 net income of \n      $89 million compared with $352 million in first quarter 2014. The \n      decrease is primarily due to the absence of $125 million of Geismar \n      business interruption insurance proceeds received in first quarter 2014 \n      and a sharp decline in NGL margins, partially offset by new fee-based \n      revenues from Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects.\n     \n     \n       Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions \n     \n     \n      For first quarter 2015, Williams Partners generated $646 million in \n      distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to partnership operations, \n      compared with $582 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations \n      in first quarter 2014.\n     \n     \n      The $64 million increase in DCF for the quarter was driven by the $149 \n      million net increase in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher \n      interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures primarily from the \n      Access Midstream merger.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners recently announced a regular quarterly cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for its common unitholders. The cash \n      distribution is consistent with the partnership\u2019s annual 2015 \n      distribution guidance of $3.40 per unit announced on Feb. 18.\n     \n     \n       CEO Perspective \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general \n      partner, made the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cFirst quarter 2015 results showed strong fee-based revenue growth from \n      the Atlantic-Gulf and Northeast G&P operating areas as well as from the \n      merger with Access. We expect the second quarter to be even higher with \n      Gulfstar One and Keathley Canyon Connector nearing full production and \n      additional projects being placed in service such as the Rockaway Lateral \n      and the mainline portion of Leidy Southeast.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe\u2019ve reaffirmed 2015-2017 guidance for Williams Partners, but we do \n      expect 2015 adjusted EBITDA and DCF to be near the low end of the range \n      due to the extended Geismar ramp-up and the effects of low commodity \n      prices on producers\u2019 volumes and ethylene margins. Our outlook for 2016 \n      and 2017 remains unchanged and we are excited about the rapid growth in \n      DCF and coverage for the balance of the year.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategy remains sound and our backlog of projects to serve the \n      demand side of the growing natural gas market continues to build.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Performance \n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Williams Partners \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Adjusted EBITDA \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           1Q 2015 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           1Q 2014 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Access Midstream (1)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          $314\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          N/A\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Atlantic-Gulf\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          335\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          266\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          NGL & Petchem Services (2)\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          7\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          236\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Northeast G&P\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          100\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          54\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          West\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          162\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          212\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Other\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          -1\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          -\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Total\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $917 \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           $768 \n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Schedules reconciling adjusted EBITDA to modified EBITDA and net \n      income are attached to this news release. \n     \n     \n       (1) First quarter 2014 represents pre-merger Williams Partners and \n      excludes Access Midstream. \n     \n     \n       (2) First quarter 2014 includes $173 million in assumed business \n      interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2013 incident at the \n      Geismar plant. \n     \n     \n       Access Midstream \n     \n     \n      Access Midstream provides gathering, treating, and compression services \n      to producers under long term, fee-based contracts in Pennsylvania, West \n      Virginia, Ohio, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

Additionally, Access Midstream \n      operates 100 percent of and owns an approximate average 45 percent \n      interest in 11 natural gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale \n      region.\n     \n     \n      Access Midstream reported adjusted EBITDA of $314 million for first \n      quarter 2015. Williams Partners\u2019 results for first quarter of 2014 are \n      on a pre-merger basis and exclude Access Midstream. For first quarter \n      2014, Access Midstream reported $250 million of adjusted EBITDA.

This segment \n      also includes midstream operations in Alberta Canada, including an oil \n      sands offgas processing plant near Fort McMurray, 260 miles of NGL and \n      olefins pipelines and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility and \n      butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater. This segment also \n      includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities marketing business, an NGL \n      fractionator and storage facilities near Conway, Kan. and a 50-percent \n      interest in Overland Pass Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted EBITDA of $7 million for first \n      quarter 2015, compared with $236 million for first quarter 2014.\n     \n     \n      The decrease in first-quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to \n      lower Geismar results. The prior year period Geismar results included \n      $173 million of business interruption insurance proceeds included in \n      adjusted EBITDA in 2014. For first quarter of 2015, the Geismar plant \n      was off-line for most of the quarter and resumed consistent operations \n      in late March. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA included $54 million lower \n      commodity-related margins primarily at the Canadian operations and \n      higher operating expenses related to the Geismar plant ramp-up.\n     \n     \n       Northeast G&P \n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and \n      processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its \n      69-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its \n      58.4-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II \n      owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream. This segment is in \n      the early stages of developing large-scale energy infrastructure \n      solutions for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.\n     \n     \n      Northeast G&P reported adjusted EBITDA of $100 million for first quarter \n      2015, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million for first quarter \n      2014.\n     \n     \n      The improved results are primarily due to a $43 million increase in \n      fee-based revenues driven by 32 percent higher volumes primarily at \n      Susquehanna Supply Hub and higher results from our investments in Blue \n      Racer and Laurel Mountain Midstream. Additionally, Ohio Valley Midstream \n      realized $7 million higher adjusted EBITDA driven by higher fee-based \n      volumes and incremental new services.\n     \n     \n       West \n     \n     \n      West includes the partnership\u2019s Northwest Pipeline interstate gas \n      pipeline system, as well as gathering, processing and treating \n      operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area.\n     \n     \n      West reported adjusted EBITDA of $162 million for first quarter 2015, \n      compared with $212 million for first quarter 2014.\n     \n     \n      Lower adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was due primarily to $40 million \n      lower NGL margins from low NGL prices.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is reaffirming its guidance for the years 2015 through \n      2017 provided on Feb. 18, 2015. We expect 2015 adjusted EBITDA and \n      distributable cash flow to be near the low end of the range due to the \n      extended Geismar ramp-up and the effects of low commodity prices on \n      volumes and margins.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 current guidance for its earnings and capital \n      expenditures are displayed in the following table:\n     \n     \n       \n

Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, \n      distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are \n      non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities \n      and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated \n      with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also \n      add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of \n      modified EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance \n      capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income \n      attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ \n      restricted stock unit non-cash compensation and certain other \n      adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of \n      results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash \n      portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these \n      items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash \n      distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects \n      the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. \n      We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly \n      comparable GAAP measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

Quarterly \n      cash distributions discussed in this news release are declared and \n      received in the following quarter, as these distributions relate to the \n      first quarter\u2019s cash flow.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported adjusted EBITDA of $918 million for first quarter \n      2015, compared with $821 million in the first quarter 2014, an increase \n      of $97 million, or 12 percent.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported adjusted income from continuing operations of $122 \n      million, or $0.16 per share, for first quarter 2015, compared with $190 \n      million, or $0.28 per share, for first quarter 2014. The variance in \n      adjusted income was driven by the absence of $173 million of business \n      interruption insurance proceeds included in adjusted results related to \n      the Geismar plant and sharp declines in NGL margins driven by low \n      prices, partially offset by new fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One and \n      Transco expansion projects.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited first quarter 2015 net income attributable \n      to Williams of $70 million, or $0.09 per share on a diluted basis, \n      compared with first quarter 2014 net income of $140 million, or $0.20 \n      per share on a diluted basis. The $70 million decrease in net income \n      attributable to Williams was primarily the result of the absence of \n      insurance proceeds received in first quarter 2014 and sharply lower NGL \n      margins, partially offset by the absence of 2014 losses associated with \n      the discontinued Bluegrass Pipeline project and new fee-based revenues \n      from Gulfstar One and Transco expansion projects.\n     \n     \n       CEO Comment \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cFirst quarter 2015 results showed strong fee-based revenue growth for \n      Williams Partners and we expect the second quarter to be even higher \n      with Gulfstar One and Keathley Canyon Connector nearing full production \n      and additional projects being placed in service such as the Rockaway \n      Lateral and the mainline portion of Leidy Southeast.\n     \n     \n      \u201cWe\u2019ve reaffirmed 2015-2017 guidance, but we do expect 2015 adjusted \n      EBITDA to be near the low end of the range due to the extended Geismar \n      ramp-up and the effects of low commodity prices on volumes and margins. \n      Williams\u2019 strong annual dividend growth rate of 10 to 15 percent through \n      2017 with growing coverage remains unchanged.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOur strategy remains sound and our backlog of projects to serve the \n      demand side of the growing natural gas market continues to build.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams \n      Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and Other.\n     \n     \n      For periods prior to July 1, 2014, the Other segment includes Williams\u2019 \n      equity earnings from its 50-percent interest in privately held Access \n      Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an approximate 23-percent \n      limited-partner interest in Access Midstream Partners, L.P.

Following the closing of the merger \n      between Williams Partners and Access Midstream, the consolidated results \n      of Access Midstream are reported as part of the Williams Partners \n      segment. Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of \n      projects in various stages of development, including the CNRL Horizon \n      offgas processing project in Canada as well as NGL and petrochemical \n      pipeline projects on the Gulf Coast. \n     \n     \n       Williams Partners Segment \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported adjusted EBITDA of $917 million for first \n      quarter 2015, compared with $768 million for first quarter 2014. The \n      increase is due primarily to the contribution of approximately $314 \n      million of adjusted EBITDA from Access Midstream as a result of the \n      merger and new fee-based revenues from Gulfstar One and Transco \n      expansion projects, partially offset by the absence of $173 million of \n      Geismar business interruption proceeds included in adjusted EBITDA in \n      2014, as well as sharply lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for first quarter 2015 are \n      provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       Other Segment \n     \n     \n      The first quarter of 2014 includes $51 million for Williams\u2019 \n      proportional share of the adjusted EBITDA from Williams\u2019 equity-method \n      investment in Access Midstream, L.P. As a result of Williams\u2019 \n      acquisition of additional ownership interests, periods after July 1, \n      2014 include the consolidated results of Access Midstream Partners. \n      Furthermore, following the closing of the merger between Williams \n      Partners and Access Midstream Partners in February 2015, the \n      consolidated results of Access Midstream for periods following July 1, \n      2014 are now reported as part of the Williams Partners segment.\n     \n     \n       Guidance \n     \n     \n      Williams is reaffirming its guidance for the years 2015 through 2017 \n      provided on Feb. 18, 2015. We expect Williams Partners\u2019 2015 adjusted \n      EBITDA and distributable cash flow to be near the low end of the range \n      due to the extended Geismar ramp-up and the effects of low

Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, \n      adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted \n      earnings per share, cash available for dividends, dividend coverage \n      ratio, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 \n      that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated \n      with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also \n      add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of \n      modified EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      For Williams, cash available for dividends is defined as cash received \n      from its ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by its NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams\u2019 cash available for \n      dividends relative to its actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      For Williams Partners L.P., we define distributable cash flow as \n      adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of \n      interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and \n      cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation \n      and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the \n      comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital \n      expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our \n      proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      For Williams Partners L.P., we also calculate the ratio of distributable \n      cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage \n      ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow \n      relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio \n      calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from continuing operations, \n      cash available for dividends, nor distributable cash flow are intended \n      to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The Northeast Connector project consists of \n      equipment to increase compression at three existing Transco facilities \n      in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and provides 100,000 dekatherms per day \n      of firm transportation capacity from Transco\u2019s Station 195 in \n      southeastern Pennsylvania to the Rockaway Delivery Lateral.\n     \n     \n      The projects were developed to help meet the long-term clean energy \n      needs of New York City while significantly enhancing reliability and \n      serving growth on the National Grid system.

This new pipeline builds upon our commitment to \n      support the Rockaway communities, as we did in the aftermath of Sandy by \n      awarding economic development grants to thousands of customers and local \n      businesses, as well as rebuilding the entire Breezy Point gas network.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Most of the Rockaway pipeline lateral was constructed offshore using \n      subsurface directional drilling technology, allowing Williams to avoid \n      all impacts to the beach, near-shore areas, as well as onshore portions \n      of Jacob Riis Park. In addition, Williams coordinated with the National \n      Park Service to develop a plan to place a state-of-the-art, \n      60,000-square-foot meter and regulator station inside two of the \n      abandoned airplane hangar buildings on Floyd Bennett Field, part of \n      Gateway National Recreation Area. Williams has partnered with the Park \n      Service to rehabilitate the exterior of the hangars to their \n      historically accurate original condition.

The implied Williams Partners unit price \n      as of May 12, 2015 represents a 14.5% premium to its 10-trading day \n      average closing price and a 12.6% premium to its 20-trading day average \n      closing price.\n     \n     \n      Upon completion of the proposed transaction, expected to occur in the \n      third quarter of 2015, the combined entity is anticipated to be one of \n      the largest and fastest-growing high-dividend paying C-Corps in the \n      energy sector with an industry-leading 10 percent to 15 percent annual \n      dividend growth rate through 2020.

We continue to see an expanding \n      portfolio of projects to connect the best supplies of natural gas and \n      natural gas products to the best markets. The lower cost of capital and \n      improved tax benefits expected from this transaction increase our \n      confidence in extending the duration of our expected 10 percent to 15 \n      percent dividend growth rate through 2020.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThis transaction simplifies our corporate structure, streamlines \n      governance and positions Williams for strong investment-grade credit \n      ratings. We anticipate significant market valuation upside and lower \n      cost of capital for new fee-based growth projects along with incremental \n      growth through strategically aligned M&A activities. Our roster of \n      large-scale, fully contracted infrastructure projects will drive \n      extraordinary adjusted EBITDA growth from an expected $5.4 billion in \n      2016 to $6.8 billion in 2018.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Transaction \n     \n     \n      Under the terms of the merger agreement, Williams will acquire all of \n      the 247 million public outstanding units of Williams Partners at a fixed \n      exchange ratio of 1.115 Williams shares for each public unit of Williams \n      Partners. In aggregate, Williams will issue 275.4 million shares in \n      connection with the proposed transaction, representing approximately 27 \n      percent of the total shares outstanding of the combined entity. The \n      transaction will be taxable to Williams Partners unitholders, and \n      Williams will receive the tax benefits from the asset step-up to be \n      realized over a 15-year period.\n     \n     \n      Williams has reviewed the proposed transaction with the rating agencies \n      and expects the combined entity will have strong investment grade credit \n      ratings consistent with Williams Partners\u2019 current ratings and outlook. \n      Williams will put in place cross guarantees among and between Williams \n      and Williams Partners to be effective on closing of the transaction in \n      order to largely eliminate the structural subordination of Williams.\n     \n     \n      The merger is expected to close in the fall of 2015 following regulatory \n      filings and the requisite approval of Williams shareholders under NYSE \n      rules.

The Williams \n      Partners Conflicts Committee recommended approval of the transaction to \n      the board of directors of the general partner of Williams Partners. The \n      transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both the general \n      partner of Williams Partners and Williams.\n     \n     \n      Barclays and Gibson Dunn acted as financial and legal advisors, \n      respectively, to Williams. Evercore and Baker Botts L.L.P. acted as \n      financial and legal advisors, respectively, to the Conflicts Committee \n      of Williams Partners, L.P.\n     \n     \n       Williams, Williams Partners Analyst Day on May 13 \n     \n     \n      Williams is scheduled to host its annual Analyst Day event May 13. \n      During the event, Williams' management will give a presentation covering \n      this announcement and give additional detail of Williams' acquisition of \n      all public outstanding units of Williams Partners L.P.

Other \n      information regarding the participants in the solicitation and a \n      description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings \n      or otherwise, will be contained in the joint solicitation \n      statement/prospectus and other relevant materials to be filed with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission when they become available.\n     \n     \n      This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation \n      of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of \n      securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale \n      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the \n      securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities \n      shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements \n      of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n     \n     \n       Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, \n      cash available for dividends and dividend coverage ratio \u2013 that are \n      non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities \n      and Exchange Commission.\n     \n     \n      Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net \n      income (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, equity \n      earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, \n      depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated \n      with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also \n      add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of \n      modified EBITDA of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful \n      insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      For Williams, cash available for dividends is defined as cash received \n      from its ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by its NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, cash taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated \n      with Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio \n      of cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid \n      (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams\u2019 cash \n      available for dividends relative to its actual cash dividends paid. This \n      transaction will result in the calculation of cash available for \n      dividends beginning with adjusted Williams EBITDA rather than the cash \n      received from its ownership in MLPs and cash received (used) by its NGL \n      & Petchem Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) \n      and also will be reduced by distributions to non-controlling interests.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company\u2019s \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA nor cash available for dividends are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n

Additionally, the ongoing operation of the \n      pipeline would generate approximately $1.9 million in annual economic \n      impact, supporting 29 jobs.\n     \n     \n      The economic modeling exercise was funded by Williams and uses IMPLAN, a \n      widely used commercial software designed to perform input-output \n      economic analysis, to estimate impacts on workforce demands, economic \n      output and value added to each of the counties where construction is \n      expected to occur. IMPLAN is used by state governments across the nation \n      for economic modeling and predicting.\n     \n     \n      In a related report titled \u201cEstimating the Impact of the Atlantic \n      Sunrise Project on Natural Gas Consumers,\u201d lead author Andrew Kleit, \n      Professor of Energy and Environmental Economics at Penn State, found \n      that consumers served by the Transco pipeline in the southeast and \n      Mid-Atlantic regions could have saved $2.6 billion from 2012-2014 due to \n      increased access to lower-priced Pennsylvania gas supply because of \n      Atlantic Sunrise.\n     \n     \n      \u201cPenn State\u2019s report clearly shows how vital this project and others \n      like it are for Pennsylvania\u2019s economy,\u201d said Pennsylvania Chamber of \n      Business & Industry President Gene Barr. \u201cWe need to take advantage of \n      all of our natural resources, and the best way to do that is through \n      more gas infrastructure. The Atlantic Sunrise expansion to the Transco \n      pipeline is projected to support thousands of jobs during construction \n      and thousands more in the drilling and supply chain industries. All \n      told, we are looking at the potential for more than a billion dollars of \n      economic activity as a result of this project.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Key findings from the analysis include: \n     \n     \n       \n        The design and construction of the project will require an investment \n        of approximately $3 billion by Williams and the co-owner of the \n        greenfield portion of the project.\n       \n       \n        The majority of the direct expenditures will be in Pennsylvania, with \n        some materials and labor sourced from other states.\n       \n       \n        The multi-year construction phase of the project is expected to result \n        in overall economic impact of $1.6 billion and could engage 8,270 \n        workers in Pennsylvania and Virginia; the 10-county Pennsylvania \n        region of the project is expected to recognize the majority of this \n        impact.\n       \n       \n        The ongoing operations of the project are predicted to generate an \n        annual economic impact of $1.96 million and support 29 direct and \n        indirect jobs in two Pennsylvania counties (Columbia and Wyoming) \n        where two new greenfield compressor facilities are proposed.\n       \n       \n        Significant federal, state and local taxes would also be generated \n        during the approximate one-year construction phase, including an \n        estimated $31 million in federal taxes and $18 million in state taxes \n        across all county locations hosting construction activity for the \n        project.\n       \n     \n     \n      \u201cConstruction and ongoing operations of the project look to be \n      economically beneficial to the counties the pipeline would cross, as \n      well as to Pennsylvania and the region,\u201d said Associate Professor Seth \n      Blumsack, John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral \n      Engineering, Pennsylvania State University.\n     \n     \n      The complete economic impact analysis is available at  www.williams.com/atlanticsunrise . \n      The site contains an economic impact tool that calculates economic \n      impacts at each local level.\n     \n     \n      The Atlantic Sunrise project is a proposed expansion of the existing \n      Transco natural gas pipeline, which currently transports about 10 \n      percent of the nation\u2019s natural gas. The Atlantic Sunrise project would \n      add about 200 miles of new pipe to expand and extend the reach of the \n      existing Transco pipeline to northeastern Pennsylvania, transporting \n      about 1.7 billion cubic feet of clean, natural gas per day \u2013 enough to \n      serve approximately 7 million homes.\n     \n     \n      \u201cAnyone who has experienced a spike in their heating bills understands \n      the importance of this project. There is a critical need for additional \n      pipeline capacity in the region so that northeastern consumers can \n      realize the full benefit of lower-cost energy,\u201d said Transco General \n      Manager Frank Ferazzi.\n     \n     \n      "},

 \n     \n      Williams reported 2014 total MLP cash distributions from Williams \n      Partners and Access Midstream Partners of $2 billion, a $447 million, or \n      29 percent, increase from total MLP cash distributions received for \n      2013. Quarterly cash distributions discussed in this news release are \n      declared and received in the following quarter, as these distributions \n      relate to the prior quarter\u2019s cash flow.\n     \n     \n      For fourth quarter 2014, Williams reported total MLP cash distributions \n      of $515 million, a $70 million, or 16 percent, increase from total MLP \n      cash distributions for fourth quarter 2013. The fourth quarter cash \n      distribution of $0.85 per unit for common unitholders of the merged MLP \n      was paid on Feb. 13 to common unitholders of record at the close of \n      business on Feb. 9.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A of $3.32 billion, \n      compared with $2.689 billion for 2013. The $631 million, or 23 percent, \n      year-over-year growth in adjusted segment profit + DD&A was driven by a \n      $632 million increase in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Access \n      Midstream.\n     \n     \n      For fourth quarter 2014, Williams reported $944 million in adjusted \n      segment profit + DD&A, compared with $728 million in the fourth quarter \n      2013. The $216 million, or 30 percent, increase for the quarter was \n      primarily driven by a $386 million increase in adjusted segment profit + \n      DD&A for Access Midstream, partially offset by a $170 million decrease \n      in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Williams Partners. The variance in \n      adjusted segment profit + DD&A for the year and the quarter are \n      discussed in the Business Segment results shown below.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported 2014 adjusted income from continuing operations of \n      $582 million, or $0.80 per share, compared with $559 million, or $0.81 \n      per share, for 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted income from continuing \n      operations was $124 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with $148 \n      million, or $0.22 per share, for fourth quarter 2013. The variance in \n      adjusted income for the full-year and quarterly periods was driven by \n      the changes in adjusted segment profit + DD&A as described in the \n      Business Segment results shown below, as well as higher net interest \n      expense, including interest associated with the acquisition of Access \n      Midstream Partners and the consolidation of Access Midstream Partners\u2019 \n      debt beginning in third quarter 2014.\n     \n     \n      Williams reported unaudited 2014 net income attributable to Williams of \n      $2.114 billion, or $2.92 per share on a diluted basis, compared with \n      2013 net income of $430 million, or $0.62 per share on a diluted basis. \n      Fourth quarter 2014 net income attributable to Williams was $193 \n      million, or $0.26 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net loss \n      of $14 million, or $0.02 per share on a diluted basis for fourth quarter \n      2013.\n     \n     \n      The $1.684 billion increase in net income attributable to Williams was \n      primarily the result of a $2.5 billion non-cash pre-tax gain resulting \n      from measuring our previous equity-method investment in Access Midstream \n      Partners at fair value related to our acquisition. This gain has been \n      adjusted out of the adjusted income from continuing operations measure \n      previously discussed.\n     \n     \n       CEO Commentary \n     \n     \n      Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made \n      the following comments:\n     \n     \n      \u201cWilliams\u2019 rapidly growing cash distributions from Williams Partners and \n      Access Midstream Partners totaled $2 billion in 2014. With the two \n      partnerships now merged into a leading large-cap MLP focused on natural \n      gas infrastructure, we\u2019re further positioned to take advantage of \n      long-term natural gas demand growth for power generation, manufacturing \n      and exports. We expect the new Williams Partners to generate \n      approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 from a gross \n      margin that is about 88 percent fee-based, the majority of which \n      consists of contracts with demand payments, cost-of-service rates or \n      minimum volume commitments.\n     \n     \n      \u201cIn the fourth quarter, Williams Partners\u2019 fee-based revenues continued \n      to grow and we began commissioning major new assets including Gulfstar \n      One, Keathley Canyon Connector and our Geismar plant. These large-scale \n      assets are ramping up in the first quarter of 2015 and are expected to \n      deliver strong contributions for the balance of the year and beyond. \n      However, the sharp decline in commodity prices, the delay in the startup \n      of Geismar and higher costs associated with the commissioning of these \n      large-scale assets, reduced our overall results.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOver the next three years, we\u2019re deploying 99 percent of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 planned $9 billion of growth capital toward fully-contracted, \n      fee-based projects. As a result, we\u2019re confident in our ability to \n      deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth amongst our \n      large-cap peers, despite lower commodity prices.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Business Segment Results \n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 business segments for 2014 financial reporting include results \n      for pre-merger Williams Partners, pre-merger Access Midstream and \n      Williams NGL & Petchem Services.\n     \n     \n      Prior to July 1, 2014, the Access Midstream segment included Williams\u2019 \n      equity earnings from its 50-percent interest in privately held Access \n      Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an approximate 23-percent \n      limited-partner interest in Access Midstream Partners, L.P. As a result \n      of our acquisition of additional ownership interests, periods after July \n      1, 2014 include the consolidated results of Access Midstream Partners.\n     \n     \n      Following the dropdown of certain of Williams\u2019 Canadian assets to \n      Williams Partners in February 2014, Williams NGL & Petchem Services \n      segment is comprised of projects in various stages of development, \n      including the offgas processor for the CNRL\u2019s Horizon upgrader plant as \n      well as petchem projects on the Gulf Coast. Prior period segment results \n      have been recast to reflect our contribution of certain Canadian assets \n      to Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n           Williams \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Full-Year 2014 \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Full-Year 2013 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Amounts in millions \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           \n             Segment Profit \n           \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           Adj.** \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n           \n             Adj.

**Adjustments for Williams Partners consist primarily of assumed \n      business interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant and the \n      removal of a contingency gain. Adjustments for Access Midstream consist \n      primarily of the non-cash remeasurement gain related to the change from \n      equity-method accounting to consolidated discussed in the body of this \n      news release. Adjustments to Williams NGL & Petchem Services consist \n      primarily of charges related to the canceled Bluegrass Pipeline project. \n     \n     \n       (1) Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of projects \n      in various stages of development, including the CNRL Horizon offgas \n      processing project in Canada as well as NGL and petrochemical pipeline \n      projects on the Gulf Coast. \n     \n     \n       Pre-Merger Williams Partners \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids \n      (NGL) transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; NGL \n      fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners reported 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A of $2.586 \n      billion, compared with $2.589 billion for 2013. The results include a \n      $199 million increase in fee-based revenues, offset by $56 million lower \n      Geismar results (including actual and assumed business interruption \n      insurance proceeds of $123 million and $311 million for 2013 and 2014, \n      respectively). Additionally, 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A was \n      reduced by $181 million as a result of commodity price declines \n      including $130 million lower NGL margins and $51 million primarily \n      related to unfavorable inventory adjustments.\n     \n     \n      Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A was $521 million, \n      compared with $691 million for fourth quarter 2013. The decrease for the \n      quarter was primarily due to $137 million lower Geismar results \n      (including actual and assumed business interruption insurance proceeds \n      of $108 million for fourth quarter 2013). The partnership estimates that \n      adjusted segment profit + DD&A would have been approximately $160 \n      million higher had the expanded Geismar plant been in operation during \n      fourth quarter 2014. Additionally, a $55 million increase in fee-based \n      revenues was more than offset by $88 million of commodity price \n      declines, including $47 million primarily related to unfavorable \n      inventory adjustments and $41 million lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      Pre-merger Williams Partners\u2019 complete financial results for 2014 are \n      provided in the year-end earnings news release issued today by the newly \n      merged MLP.\n     \n     \n       Pre-Merger Access Midstream \n     \n     \n      Due primarily to Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional ownership interests \n      in and consolidation of Access Midstream as described above, 2014 \n      adjusted segment profit + DD&A increased to $725 million, compared with \n      $93 million for 2013. Similarly, for fourth quarter 2014, adjusted \n      segment profit + DD&A increased to $422 million, compared with $36 \n      million for fourth quarter 2013.\n     \n     \n      On a standalone basis, pre-merger Access Midstream\u2019s 2014 adjusted \n      EBITDA was $1.161 billion, an increase of $302 million, or 35.2 percent, \n      compared to 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $859 million. Adjusted EBITDA for \n      fourth quarter 2014 totaled $317 million, an increase of $76 million, or \n      31.5 percent, from fourth quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $241 million.\n     \n     \n      Pre-merger Access Midstream\u2019s complete financial results for 2014 are \n      provided in the year-end earnings news release issued today by the newly \n      merged MLP.\n     \n     \n       Guidance Updates \n     \n     \n      Earnings and cash flow guidance for Williams and the newly merged MLP, \n      which is named Williams Partners, reflects the following key assumptions:\n     \n     \n      a. Substantially lower commodity price assumptions (see accompanying \n      table)\n     \n     \n      b. Lower expected fee-based volumes in certain areas as a result of the \n      lower commodity price environment\n     \n     \n      c. Our Geismar plant, which restarted in February 2015, will continue to \n      ramp up to expanded capacity through March. Production during February \n      and March is expected to be intermittent, resulting in limited financial \n      contribution for the first quarter.\n     \n     \n      d. Deferral of the planned dropdown of Williams\u2019 remaining NGL & Petchem \n      Services projects in order to reduce Williams Partners\u2019 near-term \n      capital requirements\n     \n     \n      Updated guidance for Williams Partners\u2019 2015 common unit cash \n      distributions is $3.40 with an annual growth rate of 7 percent to 11 \n      percent through 2017 with growing coverage.\n     \n     \n      Based on Williams Partners\u2019 updated cash distribution guidance, Williams \n      is updating guidance for its expected dividends per share. Guidance for \n      Williams\u2019 2015 cash dividend is $2.38 per share with an annual growth \n      rate of 10 percent to 15 percent through 2017 with growing coverage.\n     \n     \n      Williams plans to utilize revolver borrowings to fund its NGL & Petchem \n      segment growth capital totaling about $260 million in 2015. Williams\u2019 \n      financial guidance does not require any Williams\u2019 equity financing. \n      Williams\u2019 current guidance assumes approximately $600 million of \n      Williams Partners\u2019 equity financing for 2015. We anticipate meeting \n      these equity needs through Williams Partners\u2019 at-the-market program. \n      Additional Williams Partners\u2019 financing needs are expected to be met \n      primarily through issuance of long-term debt as well as revolver and \n      commercial paper borrowings. The company expects to maintain \n      investment-grade credit ratings for both Williams and Williams Partners.\n     \n     \n      Current guidance is provided in the following table:\n     \n

    The package will include the data book and analyst package.\n     \n     \n      Williams and Williams Partners plan to jointly host a conference call \n      and live webcast on Thursday, Feb. 19, at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited \n      number of phone lines will be available at (800) 768-6570. International \n      callers should dial (785) 830-1942. A link to the webcast, as well as \n      replays of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast \n      formats, will be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-K \n     \n     \n      The company plans to file its 2014 Form 10-K with the Securities and \n      Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be \n      available on both the SEC and Williams\u2019 websites.\n     \n     \n       Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, \n      adjusted segment profit and adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted \n      income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d), adjusted earnings per \n      share, cash available for dividends, dividend coverage ratio, \n      distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are \n      non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities \n      and Exchange Commission. For the following definitions, depreciation and \n      amortization (DD&A) includes amortization of basis differences related \n      to equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax \n      expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense \n      (including amortization of basis differences related to equity-method \n      investments) and equity earnings from investments, adjusted for certain \n      other items management believes affect the comparability of operating \n      results. We also add our proportional ownership share of net income \n      (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and \n      amortization expense of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted segment profit \n      excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as \n      unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may include assumed \n      business interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Adjusted \n      segment profit + DD&A is adjusted to add back depreciation and \n      amortization expense. Management believes these measures provide \n      investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.\n     \n     \n      For Williams, cash available for dividends is defined as cash received \n      from its ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by its NGL & Petchem \n      Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less \n      interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with \n      Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of \n      cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend \n      coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams\u2019 cash available for \n      dividends relative to its actual cash dividends paid.\n     \n     \n      For the newly merged MLP, Williams Partners L.P., we define \n      distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital \n      expenditures, cash paid for interest expense, distributions to \n      noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes.\n     \n     \n      For the newly merged MLP, Williams Partners L.P., we also calculate the \n      ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash \n      distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of \n      distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. We have also \n      provided this ratio calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted segment profit, adjusted segment \n      profit + DD&A, adjusted income from continuing operations, cash \n      available for dividends, nor distributable cash flow are intended to \n      represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an \n      alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not \n      be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of \n      performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted \n      accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

Cash distribution \n          coverage ratio for full-year and fourth quarter 2014 is not \n          applicable as the cash distribution paid for fourth quarter 2014 was \n          paid to unitholders of the merged MLP. Reconciliations to the most \n          relevant measures included in GAAP are attached to this news release. \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n       \n     \n     \n       Pre-Merger Williams Partners \n     \n     \n      For full-year 2014, pre-merger Williams Partners reported adjusted \n      segment profit + DD&A of $2.586 billion, compared with $2.589 billion \n      for 2013. The results include a $199 million increase in fee-based \n      revenues, offset by $56 million lower results at the Geismar olefins \n      plant (including actual and assumed business interruption insurance \n      proceeds of $123 million and $311 million for 2013 and 2014, \n      respectively). Additionally, 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A was \n      reduced by $181 million as a result of commodity price declines \n      including $130 million lower NGL margins, and $51 million primarily \n      related to unfavorable inventory adjustments.\n     \n     \n      DCF for 2014 was $1.719 billion, compared with $1.771 billion for 2013. \n      The primary drivers of DCF were the same as those that drove adjusted \n      segment profit + DD&A. Additionally maintenance capital expenditures \n      were also $97 million higher in the 2014 period, which includes $65 \n      million of unusual Geismar-related expenditures.\n     \n     \n      Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted segment profit + DD&A was $521 million, \n      compared with $691 million for fourth quarter 2013. The decrease for the \n      quarter was primarily due to $137 million lower Geismar results \n      (including actual and assumed business interruption insurance proceeds \n      of $108 million for fourth quarter 2013). The partnership estimates that \n      adjusted segment profit + DD&A would have been approximately $160 \n      million higher had the expanded Geismar plant been in operation during \n      fourth quarter 2014. Additionally, a $55 million increase in fee-based \n      revenues was more than offset by $88 million of commodity price declines \n      including $47 million primarily related to unfavorable inventory \n      adjustments and $41 million lower NGL margins.\n     \n     \n      DCF for fourth quarter 2014 was $266 million, compared with $509 million \n      for fourth quarter 2013. Again, the primary drivers for DCF were the \n      same as those that drove adjusted segment profit + DD&A, however \n      maintenance capital expenditures were $67 million higher for the 2014 \n      period, including unusual Geismar-related expenditures.\n     \n     \n       \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n           Pre-Merger Williams Partners \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           Full-Year 2014 \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           Full-Year 2013 \n         \n       \n       \n         \n          Amounts in millions\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           Adj. \n         \n         \n         \n         \n           Adj.

These large-scale assets are \n      ramping up in the first quarter of 2015 and are expected to deliver \n      strong contributions for the balance of the year and beyond. However, \n      the sharp decline in commodity prices, the delay in the startup of \n      Geismar and higher costs associated with the commissioning of these \n      large-scale assets, reduced our overall results.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe merger of Williams Partners and Access Midstream created a leading \n      large-cap MLP focused on natural gas infrastructure, and further \n      positions us to take advantage of long-term natural gas demand growth \n      for power generation, manufacturing and exports. We expect the new \n      Williams Partners to generate approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted \n      EBITDA in 2015 from a gross margin that is about 88 percent fee-based, \n      the majority of which consists of contracts with demand payments, \n      cost-of-service rates or minimum volume commitments.\n     \n     \n      \u201cOver the next three years, we\u2019re deploying 99 percent of Williams \n      Partners\u2019 planned $9.3 billion of growth capital toward \n      fully-contracted, fee-based projects. As a result, we\u2019re confident in \n      our ability to deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth \n      amongst our large-cap peers, despite lower commodity prices.\u201d\n     \n     \n       Guidance for Williams Partners (newly merged MLP) \n     \n     \n      Earnings and cash flow guidance for Williams Partners (the newly merged \n      MLP), reflects the following key assumptions:\n     \n     \n       \n         \n          a.\n         \n         \n          \u00a0\n         \n         \n          Substantially lower commodity price assumptions (see accompanying \n          table)\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          b.\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          Lower expected fee-based volumes in certain areas as a result of the \n          lower commodity price environment\n         \n       \n       \n         \n          c.\n         \n         \n         \n         \n          Our Geismar plant, which restarted in February 2015, will continue \n          to ramp up to expanded capacity through March.

A link to the webcast, as well as \n      replays of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast \n      formats, will be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com .\n     \n     \n       Form 10-K \n     \n     \n      Williams Partners\u2019 2014 Form 10-K, which will contain the pre-merger \n      results of Access Midstream Partners, is expected to be filed with the \n      Securities and Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document \n      will be available on both the SEC and Williams\u2019 websites.\n     \n     \n      Williams Partners also anticipates filing a Form 8-K next week including \n      supplemental financial statements for the post-merger partnership, which \n      will present the results for pre-merger Williams Partners and pre-merger \n      Access Midstream Partners at Williams\u2019 basis in both partnerships, \n      combined for the periods under common control since the July 1 \n      acquisition of Access Midstream Partners by Williams. Periods prior to \n      that date will primarily reflect only pre-merger Williams Partners at \n      Williams\u2019 accounting basis.\n     \n     \n       Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures \n     \n     \n      This news includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted EBITDA, \n      adjusted segment profit and adjusted segment profit + DD&A, \n      distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are \n      non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities \n      and Exchange Commission. For the following definitions, depreciation and \n      amortization (DD&A) includes amortization of basis differences related \n      to equity-method investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax \n      expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense \n      (including amortization of basis differences related to equity-method \n      investments) and equity earnings from investments, adjusted for certain \n      other items management believes affect the comparability of operating \n      results. We also add our proportional ownership share of net income \n      (loss) before income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and \n      amortization expense of equity investments.\n     \n     \n      Adjusted segment profit excludes items of income or loss that we \n      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may \n      include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar \n      plant. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is adjusted to add back \n      depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these \n      measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing \n      operations.\n     \n     \n      For the newly merged MLP, Williams Partners L.P., we define \n      distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital \n      expenditures, cash paid for interest expense, distributions to \n      noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes.\n     \n     \n      For the newly merged MLP, Williams Partners L.P., we also calculate the \n      ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash \n      distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of \n      distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. We have also \n      provided this ratio calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP \n      measure, net income.\n     \n     \n      This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP \n      financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management \n      uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial \n      indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In \n      addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an \n      enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's \n      assets and the cash that the business is generating.\n     \n     \n      Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted segment profit, adjusted segment \n      profit + DD&A, nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent \n      cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to \n      net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered \n      in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in \n      accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\n     \n     \n      "},

The Jackalope System \n      includes approximately 184 miles of low pressure gathering pipelines \n      supported by a 311,000-acre area of dedication from Chesapeake. The \n      joint venture expects volumes through the Bucking Horse plant to \n      significantly ramp-up throughout the remainder of the first quarter of \n      2015 utilizing much of its capacity as existing rich gas production is \n      re-directed from third-party processing facilities and previously \n      curtailed volumes along the Jackalope System begin to flow.\n     \n     \n      \u201cThe Bucking Horse Plant positions us for additional and continued \n      growth in the Niobrara Shale,\u201d said Walter Bennett, senior vice \n      president, Williams\u2019 West operating area. \u201cAdding this asset to the \n      Williams portfolio enhances the services we provide to Chesapeake. It \n      also expands the existing Williams footprint in Wyoming that includes \n      over 2.2 billion cubic feet per day (\u201cbcf\u201d) of combined processing \n      capacity at Opal and Echo Springs. Williams\u2019 extensive operating \n      expertise in Wyoming will allow JGGS to provide valuable midstream \n      services focused on meeting customer needs. I am very appreciative of \n      the great work by our entire Wyoming and Niobrara Shale team in coming \n      together to get this plant up and running.\u201d\n     \n     \n      Heath Deneke, president, natural gas business unit of Crestwood, \n      commented, \u201cWe are pleased to complete the Bucking Horse plant and \n      provide additional processing capacity to the underserved PRB Niobrara \n      play. We look forward to working with Williams as our joint venture \n      partner and providing Chesapeake with reliable gathering and processing \n      services.

The Constitution Pipeline is designed to enhance New York\u2019s \n      natural gas supply options via an interconnect with the existing \n      Iroquois Pipeline. Additionally, the Constitution Pipeline will provide \n      New England markets with abundant, low-cost, cleaner energy via an \n      interconnect with the existing Tennessee Gas Pipeline.\n     \n     \n      \u201cNow that FERC has issued its order, we look forward to receiving the \n      remaining approvals we need to begin construction on this pipeline so \n      that we can deliver much-needed additional natural gas supply to New \n      York and New England as quickly as possible,\u201d the project sponsors said.\n     \n     \n      FERC on Oct. 24 published its final environmental review of the proposed \n      124-mile Constitution Pipeline. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \n      assessed the potential environmental effects of the construction and \n      operation of the project in accordance with the requirements of the \n      National Environmental Policy Act. The EIS concluded that environmental \n      impacts would be reduced to \u201cless than significant levels\u201d with the \n      implementation of proposed mitigation measures by the company and FERC. \n      The FERC served in a coordinating role with relevant federal and state \n      agencies in developing its final EIS. The U.S. Environmental Protection \n      Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Highway \n      Administration, and the New York State Department of Agriculture and \n      Markets participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the \n      EIS.\n     \n     \n      The Constitution Pipeline is designed to transport enough natural gas \n      each day to serve approximately 3 million homes in the U.S. Northeast. \n      The project involves the construction and operation of 124 miles of \n      30-inch-diameter pipeline from natural gas supply areas in northeast \n      Pennsylvania and connecting with existing transmission pipelines in \n      Schoharie County, N.Y. Earlier this year, Constitution Pipeline and \n      Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC announced plans to install four \n      delivery taps along Constitution's proposed route to facilitate local \n      natural gas service to homes and businesses in southern New York and \n      northern Pennsylvania.\n     \n     \n       Constitution Pipeline Company \n     \n     \n      Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC is owned by subsidiaries of  Williams \n      Partners L.P.

In December 2012, Williams paid $2.25 billion to private \n      equity fund Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for ownership interest \n      in Access. Williams and GIP each owned 50 percent interest in Access \n      with a right-of-first-offer on the sale of each other\u2019s interests.\n     \n     \n      Williams\u2019 initial investment in Access proved to be financially \n      rewarding with the per unit price nearly doubling from $32 in December \n      2012 to $65 in June 2014 prior to the second acquisition. This initial \n      stake also provided Williams good visibility into Access\u2019 business. \n      Williams found that Access complemented its commercial, financial and \n      people strategies. Eighteen months after its initial investment, \n      Williams decided to exercise its right to acquire the balance of Access \n      from GIP for $5.995 billion.\n     \n     \n      The $8.2 billion total investment \u2013 executed in a deliberate, two-phase \n      transaction \u2013 shot Williams\u2019 stock to an all-time high and drove it to \n      the No. 1 performer in the S&P 500 for second-quarter 2014, far \n      outpacing energy peers and companies across other industries.\n     \n     \n      "},

(NYSE: WPZ) and  Access        Midstream Partners, L.P.  (NYSE: ACMP) today announced that Williams        Partners and Access Midstream Partners have entered into a merger        agreement. Williams owns controlling interests in the two master limited        partnerships (MLP).                   \u201cThis is another big step toward our goal of becoming the leading        natural gas infrastructure provider in North America,\u201d said        Williams\u2019\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Alan Armstrong. \u201cThe combination        of\u00a0Access Midstream Partners\u2019 intense focus on natural gas gathering        with\u00a0Williams Partners\u2019\u00a0broader service offerings along the value        chain\u00a0is yielding even more robust\u00a0growth opportunities.\u00a0Additionally,        the people at both partnerships bring valuable skills, experiences and        best practices that will strengthen the combined partnership\u2019s ability        to\u00a0execute\u00a0and grow. This transaction advances our strategy to connect        the best supplies\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0best markets by allowing us to provide even        more service and market options for our customers.\"                   Upon completion of the merger, expected to occur by early 2015, the        merged MLP is anticipated to be one of the largest and fastest growing        MLPs with expected 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion,        industry-leading 10% to 12% annual limited partner unit distribution        growth rate through the 2017 guidance period and with expected strong        growth beyond. Distribution coverage is expected to be at or above 1.1x        or an aggregate of $1.1 billion through the 2017 guidance period. Cash        distributions for 2015 are expected to total $3.65 per limited partner        unit, up 50% and 30% over ACMP\u2019s 2014 and 2015 distribution guidance,        respectively. The merged MLP expects to pay a regular cash distribution        in the first quarter of 2015 in the amount of $0.85 per unit, up 53%        over the ACMP distribution paid in the first quarter of the prior year        (assuming that the merger closes before the distribution record date).        Full financial guidance for the merged MLP is expected to be announced        following completion of the merger.                   \u201cBoth Access and Williams Partners are experiencing robust growth, and        this growth will benefit both our customers and our employees,\u201d said        ACMP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Mike Stice. \u201cWe expect customers to        benefit from the expanded organizational capability and enhanced        national scale that the combined business provides. We\u2019re already seeing        employees benefit from opportunities for advancement and from the        additional benefits of being a member of the larger Williams family.\u201d                   The merged MLP will feature large-scale positions across three key        components of the midstream sector, including natural gas pipelines,        gathering and processing and natural gas liquids and petrochemical        services.                             Natural Gas Pipelines \u2013 Transco, Northwest and Gulfstream represent          the nation's premier interstate pipeline network. Transco is the          nation's largest and fastest-growing pipeline system.                         Gathering and Processing \u2013 Large-scale positions in growing          natural-gas supply areas in major shale and unconventional producing          areas, including the Marcellus, Utica, Piceance, Four Corners,          Wyoming, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Barnett, Mid-continent and Niobrara.          Additionally, the merged MLP\u2019s business would include oil and natural          gas gathering services in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                         Natural Gas Liquids and Petrochemical Services \u2013 Unique downstream          presence on the Gulf Coast and in western Canada provides          differentiated long-term growth.                            Key Merger Agreement Terms                    Under the terms of the merger agreement, WPZ will merge with a        subsidiary of ACMP in a unit-for-unit exchange at a ratio of 0.86672        ACMP common units per WPZ common unit held by the WPZ public        unitholders. Williams initially proposed the merger of ACMP and WPZ on        June 15, 2014, concurrent with the announcement that Williams had        acquired the ACMP common units and general partner interests in ACMP        owned by Global Infrastructure Partners. Under the original terms,        Williams proposed that ACMP would acquire WPZ at an exchange ratio of        0.85 ACMP common units for each WPZ common unit plus additional        consideration of $0.81 per WPZ common unit to be paid by ACMP in cash or        additional ACMP common units. After subsequent negotiations, the parties        agreed that the WPZ public unitholders would receive 0.86672 ACMP common        units which represented the original 0.85 ACMP common units plus        additional consideration of approximately $1.02 per WPZ common unit in        the form of additional ACMP common units, based on the closing price of        ACMP as of October 24, 2014. Williams agreed to reduce the exchange        ratio it would receive in the merger to offset the approximately $1.02        of value provided to the WPZ public unitholders.                   Prior to the completion of the merger, ACMP will effect a subdivision of        its common units and each public unitholder of ACMP will receive 0.06152        additional ACMP common units for each ACMP common unit they hold.\u00a0In the        aggregate, the public unitholders of ACMP will receive approximately 6.3        million new ACMP common units with a value of approximately $381        million, or approximately $3.74 per public ACMP common unit, based on        the closing price of ACMP as of October 24, 2014. The 6.3 million units,        or approximately $381 million, represents additional value for ACMP        public unitholders versus the original June proposal. Williams agreed to        reduce the exchange ratio it would receive in the merger to offset the        approximately $3.74 of value provided to the ACMP unitholders in the        subdivision of the ACMP common units. Taking into account the impact of        the subdivision of the ACMP common units and the terms of the merger        agreement, the ACMP conflicts committee concluded the impact of the        transactions on the public ACMP unitholders represents an effective        exchange ratio of approximately 0.80 ACMP common units for each WPZ        common unit outstanding (as compared to the original 0.85        pre-subdivision proposal).                   Prior to the merger, Williams will hold approximately 306.4 million WPZ        common units (including WPZ Class D Units which will convert to common        units in conjunction with the merger) and approximately 101.8 million        ACMP common units (including approximately 12.9 million ACMP Class B        Units).\u00a0Upon consummation of the merger and related transactions,        Williams is expected to receive approximately 251.5 million ACMP common        units (including approximately 800 thousand ACMP Class B Units),        representing a net effective exchange ratio of approximately 0.82080        ACMP common units for each WPZ common unit held by Williams. After        giving effect to the merger and related transactions, Williams is        expected to hold approximately 353.3 million ACMP common units        (including approximately 13.7 million ACMP Class B Units), representing        approximately 58.8% of the limited partner interest in the merged        MLP.\u00a0In the merger and related transactions, Williams will receive        approximately 8.9 million fewer ACMP common units (or approximately $544        million, based on the closing price of ACMP as of October 24, 2014) than        it would have received in the June proposal. Under their existing terms,        all of the ACMP Class B Units will convert to ACMP common units in        February 2015 following the record date for the fourth quarter        distribution. Williams will continue to own 100% of the general partner        interest and related incentive distribution rights and will continue to        control the merged MLP.                   The merger terms were negotiated, reviewed and approved by the conflicts        committees of the boards of directors of the general partner of each        partnership. Each of the ACMP Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of        the independent members of the board of directors of ACMP\u2019s general        partner, and the WPZ Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of the        independent members of the board of directors of WPZ\u2019s general partner,        has unanimously approved the merger, the merger agreement and the        related transactions. As part of their evaluation process, the conflicts        committees retained independent legal and financial advisors and each        committee received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor.                   The approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by WPZ        requires approval by a majority of the outstanding WPZ common units. A        subsidiary of Williams, Williams Gas Pipeline Company LLC, which owns a        sufficient number of WPZ common units to approve the merger on behalf of        all WPZ unitholders, has executed a support agreement in which it has        irrevocably agreed to consent to the merger. The closing of the merger        is subject to customary closing conditions, including effectiveness of a        registration statement on Form S-4 related to the issuance of new ACMP        common units to the WPZ common unit holders.                   As a result of the merger, WPZ will become wholly owned by ACMP. The        merged MLP will be named Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) and will be        based in Tulsa with major offices in Oklahoma City, Houston, Pittsburgh,        Salt Lake City and Calgary.                    Williams Dividend Increases & Transition to Pure Play GP Holding        Company                    As planned, Williams increased its third-quarter 2014 dividend 32% to        $0.56, or $2.24 on an annualized basis. The sharp increase in the third        quarter dividend resulted from Williams\u2019 July 1 acquisition of        controlling interests in ACMP as well as the decision to accelerate its        planned shift to a pure play GP holding company. In addition to the        third-quarter 2014 dividend increase, Williams also is affirming        dividend-growth guidance of approximately 15% annually \u2013 from the higher        third-quarter 2014 base \u2013 through 2017 with planned dividends of        approximately $1.96 in 2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82 in 2016, and $3.25 in        2017. Williams expects excess cash flow available after dividends of        more than $300 million for the two-year-period 2015 through 2016.                   To complete Williams' transition to a pure-play GP holding company,        Williams plans to complete the drop-down of its remaining NGL & Petchem        Services assets and projects by late 2014 or early 2015. Williams        expects to have invested approximately $600 million in the drop-down        assets by year-end 2014. This drop-down transaction will be subject to        WPZ\u2019s board conflicts committee analysis and approval. WPZ expects to        finance this acquisition with revolver borrowings or long-term debt.        Williams plans to use cash proceeds from the dropdown to repay revolver        borrowings and for general corporate purposes.                   Williams was advised by UBS Investment Bank, Barclays, Citi and Gibson        Dunn. The WPZ conflicts committee was advised by Robert W. Baird & Co.        Incorporated and Baker Botts L.L.P. The ACMP conflicts committee was        advised by Evercore and Richards, Layton & Finger. ACMP was advised by        Latham & Watkins.                    Management Changes                    In conjunction with today\u2019s merger-agreement announcement, the following        management changes are planned:                   Following the closing of the merger, it is expected that J. Mike Stice        will continue in his role as a director of the general partner of the        merged MLP. Stice, who currently serves as chief executive officer of        the general partner of ACMP, will retire as an officer of the company        upon the closing of the merger.                   Robert S. Purgason, current chief operating officer of the general        partner of ACMP, is expected to join Williams as senior vice president        overseeing the ACMP operations. Purgason will report directly to        Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer Alan Armstrong. When the        merger is complete, it is expected that Purgason also will serve the        merged MLP as one of its general partner\u2019s senior vice presidents,        rather than as its chief operating officer.                   David C. Shiels, who currently serves as chief financial officer of the        general partner of ACMP will leave the company to pursue other        opportunities after the merger closes. He will continue in his current        role until the merger is complete.                   Upon the closing of the merger, it is expected that Alan Armstrong and        Donald Chappel will serve the merged MLP as its general partner\u2019s chief        executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. Chappel        currently serves as chief financial officer of Williams and Williams        Partners.                   \u201cI want to recognize and thank Mike, Bob and Dave, along with the rest        of the Access Midstream organization, for their achievements to build an        organization that has delivered significant value for investors,        customers, employees and the communities where they have operations,\u201d        Armstrong said. \u201cWe look forward to expanding on that value creation as        we continue to integrate our organizations and operations.\u201d                   "},

Williams initially proposed the merger of ACMP and WPZ on        June 15, 2014, concurrent with the announcement that Williams had        acquired the ACMP common units and general partner interests in ACMP        owned by Global Infrastructure Partners. Under the original terms,        Williams proposed that ACMP would acquire WPZ at an exchange ratio of        0.85 ACMP common units for each WPZ common unit plus additional        consideration of $0.81 per WPZ common unit to be paid by ACMP in cash or        additional ACMP common units. After subsequent negotiations, the parties        agreed that the WPZ public unitholders would receive 0.86672 ACMP common        units which represented the original 0.85 ACMP common units plus        additional consideration of approximately $1.02 per WPZ common unit in        the form of additional ACMP common units, based on the closing price of        ACMP as of October 24, 2014. Williams agreed to reduce the exchange        ratio it would receive in the merger to offset the approximately $1.02        of value provided to the WPZ public unitholders.                   Prior to the completion of the merger, ACMP will effect a subdivision of        its common units and each public unitholder of ACMP will receive 0.06152        additional ACMP common units for each ACMP common unit they hold.\u00a0In the        aggregate, the public unitholders of ACMP will receive approximately 6.3        million new ACMP common units with a value of approximately $381        million, or approximately $3.74 per public ACMP common unit, based on        the closing price of ACMP as of October 24, 2014. The 6.3 million units,        or approximately $381 million, represents additional value for ACMP        public unitholders versus the original June proposal. Williams agreed to        reduce the exchange ratio it would receive in the merger to offset the        approximately $3.74 of value provided to the ACMP unitholders in the        subdivision of the ACMP common units. Taking into account the impact of        the subdivision of the ACMP common units and the terms of the merger        agreement, the ACMP conflicts committee concluded the impact of the        transactions on the public ACMP unitholders represents an effective        exchange ratio of approximately 0.80 ACMP common units for each WPZ        common unit outstanding (as compared to the original 0.85        pre-subdivision proposal).                   Prior to the merger, Williams will hold approximately 306.4 million WPZ        common units (including WPZ Class D Units which will convert to common        units in conjunction with the merger) and approximately 101.8 million        ACMP common units (including approximately 12.9 million ACMP Class B        Units).\u00a0Upon consummation of the merger and related transactions,        Williams is expected to receive approximately 251.5 million ACMP common        units (including approximately 800 thousand ACMP Class B Units),        representing a net effective exchange ratio of approximately 0.82080        ACMP common units for each WPZ common unit held by Williams. After        giving effect to the merger and related transactions, Williams is        expected to hold approximately 353.3 million ACMP common units        (including approximately 13.7 million ACMP Class B Units), representing        approximately 58.8% of the limited partner interest in the merged        MLP.\u00a0In the merger and related transactions, Williams will receive        approximately 8.9 million fewer ACMP common units (or approximately $544        million, based on the closing price of ACMP as of October 24, 2014) than        it would have received in the June proposal. Under their existing terms,        all of the ACMP Class B Units will convert to ACMP common units in        February 2015 following the record date for the fourth quarter        distribution. Williams will continue to own 100% of the general partner        interest and related incentive distribution rights and will continue to        control the merged MLP.                   The merger terms were negotiated, reviewed and approved by the conflicts        committees of the boards of directors of the general partner of each        partnership. Each of the ACMP Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of        the independent members of the board of directors of ACMP\u2019s general        partner, and the WPZ Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of the        independent members of the board of directors of WPZ\u2019s general partner,        has unanimously approved the merger, the merger agreement and the        related transactions. As part of their evaluation process, the conflicts        committees retained independent legal and financial advisors and each        committee received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor.                   The approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by WPZ        requires approval by a majority of the outstanding WPZ common units. A        subsidiary of Williams, Williams Gas Pipeline Company LLC, which owns a        sufficient number of WPZ common units to approve the merger on behalf of        all WPZ unitholders, has executed a support agreement in which it has        irrevocably agreed to consent to the merger. The closing of the merger        is subject to customary closing conditions, including effectiveness of a        registration statement on Form S-4 related to the issuance of new ACMP        common units to the WPZ common unit holders.                   As a result of the merger, WPZ will become wholly owned by ACMP. The        merged MLP will be named Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) and will be        based in Tulsa with major offices in Oklahoma City, Houston, Pittsburgh,        Salt Lake City and Calgary.                    Williams Dividend Increases & Transition to Pure Play GP Holding        Company                    As planned, Williams increased its third-quarter 2014 dividend 32% to        $0.56, or $2.24 on an annualized basis. The sharp increase in the third        quarter dividend resulted from Williams\u2019 July 1 acquisition of        controlling interests in ACMP as well as the decision to accelerate its        planned shift to a pure play GP holding company. In addition to the        third-quarter 2014 dividend increase, Williams also is affirming        dividend-growth guidance of approximately 15% annually \u2013 from the higher        third-quarter 2014 base \u2013 through 2017 with planned dividends of        approximately $1.96 in 2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82 in 2016, and $3.25 in        2017. Williams expects excess cash flow available after dividends of        more than $300 million for the two-year-period 2015 through 2016.                   To complete Williams' transition to a pure-play GP holding company,        Williams plans to complete the drop-down of its remaining NGL & Petchem        Services assets and projects by late 2014 or early 2015. Williams        expects to have invested approximately $600 million in the drop-down        assets by year-end 2014. This drop-down transaction will be subject to        WPZ\u2019s board conflicts committee analysis and approval. WPZ expects to        finance this acquisition with revolver borrowings or long-term debt.        Williams plans to use cash proceeds from the dropdown to repay revolver        borrowings and for general corporate purposes.                   Williams was advised by UBS Investment Bank, Barclays, Citi and Gibson        Dunn. The WPZ conflicts committee was advised by Robert W. Baird & Co.        Incorporated and Baker Botts L.L.P. The ACMP conflicts committee was        advised by Evercore and Richards, Layton & Finger. ACMP was advised by        Latham & Watkins.                    Management Changes                    In conjunction with today\u2019s merger-agreement announcement, the following        management changes are planned:                   Following the closing of the merger, it is expected that J. Mike Stice        will continue in his role as a director of the general partner of the        merged MLP. Stice, who currently serves as chief executive officer of        the general partner of ACMP, will retire as an officer of the company        upon the closing of the merger.                   Robert S. Purgason, current chief operating officer of the general        partner of ACMP, is expected to join Williams as senior vice president        overseeing the ACMP operations. Purgason will report directly to        Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer Alan Armstrong. When the        merger is complete, it is expected that Purgason also will serve the        merged MLP as one of its general partner\u2019s senior vice presidents,        rather than as its chief operating officer.                   David C. Shiels, who currently serves as chief financial officer of the        general partner of ACMP will leave the company to pursue other        opportunities after the merger closes. He will continue in his current        role until the merger is complete.                   Upon the closing of the merger, it is expected that Alan Armstrong and        Donald Chappel will serve the merged MLP as its general partner\u2019s chief        executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. Chappel        currently serves as chief financial officer of Williams and Williams        Partners.                   \u201cI want to recognize and thank Mike, Bob and Dave, along with the rest        of the Access Midstream organization, for their achievements to build an        organization that has delivered significant value for investors,        customers, employees and the communities where they have operations,\u201d        Armstrong said. \u201cWe look forward to expanding on that value creation as        we continue to integrate our organizations and operations.\u201d                   "},

The quarterly cash distributions discussed in        this release are declared and received in the following quarter, as        these distributions relate to the prior quarter\u2019s cash flow.                   Year-to-date 2014, Williams reported cash distributions from Williams        Partners and Access Midstream Partners of $1.485 billion, a $377        million, or 34 percent increase from the same period last year.                   For third-quarter 2014, Williams reported $838 million in adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, compared with $618 million in third-quarter 2013.        The $220 million increase for the quarter was driven by a $238 million        increase in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Access Midstream        Partners. This increase was primarily the result of Williams\u2019        acquisition of additional ownership interests on July 1, 2014. As a        result of the acquisition of these additional ownership interests, the        Access Midstream Partners segment includes the consolidated results of        Access Midstream Partners for periods after July 1, 2014. Williams        Partners\u2019 adjusted segment profit + DD&A for the quarter declined $20        million, driven by a $45 million decrease in natural gas liquids (NGL)        and marketing margins, substantially offset by a $35 million increase in        fee-based revenues. The Geismar plant was off-line for both periods;        however, assumed business interruption insurance proceeds for the third        quarter of 2013 totaled $15 million and were included in the calculation        of adjusted segment profit + DD&A. The partnership estimates that        adjusted segment profit + DD&A would have been approximately $200        million higher had the expanded Geismar plant been in operation during        the third quarter. The partnership expects the expanded Geismar plant to        be placed into service in November 2014.                   Year-to-date adjusted segment profit + DD&A was $2.376 billion, compared        with $1.961 billion year-to-date 2013. The $415 million, or 21 percent        year-over-year growth in adjusted segment profit + DD&A was driven by a        $246 million increase in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Access        Midstream Partners and a $167 million increase for Williams Partners.        The Access Midstream Partners increase is primarily the result of the        consolidation discussed with respect to the third quarter. The Williams        Partners\u2019 increase includes $144 million, or 7 percent, growth in        fee-based revenues compared with the year-to-date 2013 period, as well        as $81 million in higher Geismar results, which include the favorable        impacts of the assumed business interruption insurance proceeds.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations for third-quarter 2014 was        $110 million, or $0.15 per share, compared with $130 million, or $0.19        per share for third-quarter 2013. Year-to-date through Sept. 30,        adjusted income from continuing operations was $458 million, or $0.64        per share, compared with $411 million, or $0.60 per share, for the first        nine months of 2013.                   The decrease in adjusted income for the quarter was driven by $86        million higher net interest expense, including interest associated with        debt at Access Midstream Partners, and $28 million lower NGL margins,        partially offset by the segment results of our now consolidated Access        Midstream Partners business and growth in Williams Partners\u2019 fee-based        revenues.                   The increase in adjusted income for the year-to-date period was driven        by $144 million higher Williams Partners fee-based revenues and the        segment results of our now consolidated Access Midstream Partners        business. Adjusted income for the year-to-date period was also driven by        $86 million higher adjusted results from our Geismar plant reflecting        the favorable impact of assumed business interruption insurance proceeds        through the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by higher net        interest expense, including interest associated with the debt at Access        Midstream Partners, and lower NGL margins.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted segment profit +        DD&A are non-GAAP measures and reflect the removal of items considered        unrepresentative of ongoing operations and may include assumed business        interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Reconciliations to        the most relevant GAAP measures are attached to this news release.                   Williams reported unaudited third-quarter 2014 net income attributable        to Williams of $1.678 billion, or $2.22 per share on a diluted basis,        compared with net income of $141 million, or $0.20 per share on a        diluted basis, for third-quarter 2013.                   The $1.537 billion increase in net income during third-quarter 2014 was        primarily the result of a $2.522 billion pre-tax non-cash re-measurement        gain related to the consolidation of our previous equity-method        investment in Access Midstream Partners as of July 1, 2014. This gain        has been adjusted out of the adjusted income from continuing operations        measure previously discussed.                   For the first nine months of 2014, Williams reported net income of        $1.921 billion, or $2.68 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net        income of $444 million, or $0.65 per share, for the same time period in        2013.                   The increase in net income for the first nine months of 2014 was also        primarily due to the non-cash gain related to the consolidation of        Access Midstream Partners previously discussed.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWilliams\u2019 third quarter results continued to benefit from our increased        ownership of Access Midstream Partners. During four consecutive weeks in        September, ACMP achieved average gross daily gathering volumes in excess        of 6 Bcf per day, a volume record that drove strong financial results.        As expected, Williams Partners\u2019 lower results versus normal operations        were due primarily to the Geismar outage and the first full-quarter        without the assumed benefit of Geismar-related business interruption        insurance proceeds.                   \u201cWe expect dramatically higher results for Williams Partners in the        fourth quarter and 2015. In November and December, we plan to place        several major projects into service, including the expanded Geismar        plant, the Gulfstar One facility and the Keathley Canyon Connector        pipeline. All three of these large-scale projects are mechanically        complete and are expected to generate nearly $1 billion in 2015 cash        flows,\u201d Armstrong said.                   \u201cWe recently received strong customer interest in new major natural gas        infrastructure projects, Transco\u2019s Appalachian Connector and Diamond        East pipelines. Both are designed to connect growing Transco markets to        abundant, economically priced Marcellus and Utica supply. On the        regulatory front, we achieved a key milestone with the FERC\u2019s issuance        last week of its final environmental impact statement for the        Constitution Pipeline project. We\u2019re pursuing the federal and state        permits we need in an effort to begin construction as early as the first        quarter of 2015. This schedule is critical to our ability to bring the        Constitution Pipeline in service in time to meet the winter 2015-16        heating season in New York and New England.                   \u201cEarlier this week, we took another big step toward our goal of becoming        the leading provider of large-scale natural gas infrastructure in North        America when Williams Partners and Access Midstream agreed to merge.        With the expected close of the merger in early 2015 and the planned        dropdown of Williams\u2019 remaining businesses to Williams Partners, we will        be a large-cap, pure-play general partner with planned industry-leading        dividend growth of 15 percent annually through 2017, on top of our 32        percent increase in third-quarter 2014.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Access Midstream Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and        Other.                   The Williams Partners segment includes the consolidated results of  Williams        Partners L.P.  (NYSE: WPZ). Prior to July 1, 2014, Access Midstream        Partners included the company\u2019s equity earnings from its 50-percent        interest in privately held Access Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an        approximate 23-percent limited-partner interest in  Access        Midstream Partners, L.P.  (NYSE: ACMP). As a result of our        acquisition of additional ownership interests, periods after July 1,        2014 include the consolidated results of Access Midstream Partners.        Following the dropdown of Williams\u2019 currently operational Canadian        assets to Williams Partners in February 2014, Williams NGL & Petchem        Services segment is comprised of various developmental-stage projects.        Prior period segment results have been recast to reflect our        contribution of certain Canadian assets to Williams Partners.                                                             \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                                                                    Williams                                                                         3Q - 2014                                                                         3Q - 2013                                                 Amounts in millions                                                                                       Segment Profit                                            \u00a0                                Adj.**                                \u00a0                                              Adj.

Adjustments for Access Midstream Partners consist primarily of the            non-cash remeasurement gain related to the change from equity-method            accounting to consolidated discussed in the body of this news            release. Adjustments to Williams NGL & Petchem Services consist            primarily of charges related to the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline            project.                                                \u00a0                                      Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas and natural gas liquids        transportation, gathering, treating, processing and storage; natural gas        liquids fractionation; olefins production; and crude oil transportation.                   Williams received regular quarterly cash distributions of $431 million        from Williams Partners L.P. during third-quarter 2014 and is expected to        receive distributions totaling $438 million in November. There is a more        detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 business results in the        partnership\u2019s third-quarter 2014 financial results news release, also        issued today.                   For third-quarter 2014, Williams Partners reported adjusted segment        profit + DD&A of $575 million, compared with $595 million for        third-quarter 2013.                   The decrease for the quarter was driven by a $45 million decrease in NGL        and marketing margins, substantially offset by a $35 million increase in        fee-based revenues. The Geismar plant was off-line for both periods;        however, assumed business interruption insurance proceeds for        third-quarter 2013 totaled $15 million and were included in the        calculation of adjusted segment profit + DD&A.                   Year-to-date through September 30, Williams Partners reported $2.065        billion in adjusted segment profit + DD&A, compared with $1.898 billion        for the same period in 2013.                   For the nine months of 2014, the Williams Partners increase includes        $144 million, or 7 percent, growth in fee-based revenues compared with        the year-to-date 2013 period, as well as $81 million in higher Geismar        results, which include the favorable impacts of the assumed business        interruption insurance proceeds.                    Access Midstream Partners                    Access Midstream Partners reported adjusted segment profit + DD&A of        $260 million compared with $22 million for third-quarter 2013, primarily        reflecting our increased ownership interest in and the consolidation of        Access Midstream Partners beginning in the third quarter of 2014.        Williams received a regular quarterly distribution of $78 million from        Access Midstream Partners during third-quarter 2014 and is expected to        receive distributions totaling $83 million in November.                   Year-to-date 2014, Access Midstream Partners reported adjusted segment        profit + DD&A of $303 million compared with $57 million for year-to-date        2013. Year-to-date 2014, Access Midstream Partners\u2019 cash distributions        to Williams total $194 million.                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services                    As previously mentioned, following the dropdown of Williams\u2019 currently        operational Canadian assets to Williams Partners in February 2014,        Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of various        developmental-stage projects in Canada and the Gulf Coast.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted segment loss + DD&A of        $4 million for third-quarter 2014, compared with a loss of $4 million        for third-quarter 2013.                   Year-to-date 2014, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted        segment loss + DD&A of $15 million, compared with a loss of $7 million        year-to-date 2013.                    Guidance                    In addition to the third-quarter 2014 dividend increase, Williams also        is affirming dividend-growth guidance of approximately 15 percent        annually \u2013 from the higher third-quarter 2014 base \u2013 through 2017 with        planned dividends of approximately $1.96 in 2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82        in 2016, $3.25 in 2017. The company expects continued strong dividend        growth beyond the guidance period. Assuming the merger closes in January        2015, Williams expects excess cash flow available after dividends of        more than $300 million for the two-year period 2015 through 2016. The        expected quarterly increases in Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to        quarterly approval of the company\u2019s board of directors.                   Williams\u2019 current guidance for earnings, cash flow and capital        expenditures are unchanged from guidance issued in July 2014; however,        this guidance does not reflect the effects of the merger agreement        announced Oct. 26, 2014.                   Key elements of the merged MLP\u2019s financial guidance were disclosed along        with the merger announcement and are as follows:                             2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion.                         Pay regular cash distribution during 1Q 2015 in the amount of $0.85          per unit (assuming that the merger closes before the distribution          record date).                         Cash distribution per limited partner unit for 2015 of $3.65.                         Best-in-class 10 to 12 percent annual distribution growth in each of          2016 and 2017 and strong growth beyond.                         Distribution coverage is expected to be at or above 1.1x or an          aggregate of $1.1 billion of excess cash flow through 2017.                         Strong investment-grade credit ratings with limited equity needs in          current business plan.                           The merged MLP expects to provide additional consolidated guidance        following the completion of the merger, which is expected in early 2015.                   Adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Williams Partners for 2014 includes        an assumption of a full recovery of property damage and business        interruption insurance proceeds related to the Geismar incident as well        as the successful restart of the Geismar plant in November 2014.        Williams Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and        property damage insurance related to the Geismar incident (subject to        deductibles and other limitations). Risks associated with the expected        full recovery of $500 million in insurance proceeds related to the        Geismar incident could result in full-year 2014 adjusted segment profit        + DD&A that is below the guidance range. In the second quarter, the        insurers paid $50 million of the most recent claim-payment request of        $200 million and the total insurance receipts to-date are $225 million.        The insurers continue to evaluate Williams Partners\u2019 claims and have        raised questions around key assumptions involving our        business-interruption claim. As a result, the insurers have elected to        make a partial payment pending further assessment of these issues.        Williams Partners continues to work with insurers in support of all        claims, as submitted, and is vigorously pursuing collection of the        remaining $275 million insurance limits.                   Williams Partners, in consultation with its independent experts,        presented further support for the partnership\u2019s insurance claim to our        insurers in September 2014 and have agreed with insurers to non-binding        mediation, which is scheduled to begin in late November, in an effort to        advance the resolution of the claim.                   The assumed expanded plant restart date and repair cost estimate are        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions. The assumed        property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds are also        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions.                   Williams\u2019 current guidance is displayed below. However, the table does        not reflect the effects of the merger agreement announced Oct. 26, 2014.                                                             \u00a0

Form 10-Q                    The company plans to file its third-quarter 2014 Form 10-Q with the        Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document        will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted income from        continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013        that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations and may include assumed business interruption        insurance related to the Geismar plant. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into the company's results        from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Oct. 24 published its final        environmental review of the proposed 124-mile Constitution Pipeline. The        FERC action is a key step toward the commission's decision on the        project, which is expected as early as late November.                   Assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals,        Constitution Pipeline would begin construction as early as the        first-quarter next year in order to help meet winter 2015-16        heating-season needs in New York and New England.                   \u201cAfter a long and comprehensive review of our proposed route, as well as        significant route alternatives, the FERC\u2019s Final Environmental Impact        Statement confirms that the Constitution Pipeline can be constructed in        a manner that minimizes environmental impacts, while adding a key piece        of natural gas infrastructure to the U.S. Northeast,\u201d the project        sponsors said in a joint statement. \u201cOnce in service, the Constitution        Pipeline will provide important access to new, domestic sources of        natural gas, bolstering supply reliability and contributing toward        stabilization of the prices consumers pay for energy.\u201d                   Specific to New England, insufficient natural gas pipeline        infrastructure last winter had the effect of exposing consumers to high        natural gas prices and, as a result, higher electric-power costs. The        Constitution Pipeline is designed to help address the issue by        connecting New England markets with abundant, low-cost, cleaner energy        via an interconnect with the existing Tennessee Pipeline. Additionally,        the Constitution Pipeline is designed to enhance New York\u2019s natural gas        supply options via an interconnect with the existing Iroquois Pipeline.                   \u201cWe look forward to the issuance of the final FERC Order, as well as        other applicable approvals we need to begin construction on this        pipeline so that we can deliver much-needed additional natural gas        supply to New York and New England as quickly as possible,\u201d the project        sponsors said.                   Earlier this year, Constitution Pipeline and Leatherstocking Gas        Company, LLC announced plans to install four delivery taps along        Constitution's proposed route to facilitate local natural gas service to        homes and businesses in southern New York and northern Pennsylvania.                   The FERC Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) assesses the potential        environmental effects of the construction and operation of the projects        in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy        Act. The EIS concluded that environmental impacts would be reduced to        \u201cless than significant levels\u201d with the implementation of proposed        mitigation measures by the company and FERC.                   The FERC served in a coordinating role with relevant federal and state        agencies in developing its final EIS. The U.S. Environmental Protection        Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Highway        Administration, and the New York State Department of Agriculture and        Markets also participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of        the EIS.                   The FERC\u2019s 90-day federal authorization decision deadline for the        project is set for Jan. 22, 2015.                   The Constitution Pipeline is designed to transport enough natural gas        each day to serve approximately 3 million homes in the U.S. Northeast.        The project involves the construction and operation of 124 miles of        30-inch-diameter pipeline from natural gas supply areas in northeast        Pennsylvania and connecting with existing transmission pipelines in        Schoharie County, N.Y.

Williams now owns 100 percent of the general        partner and approximately 50 percent of the limited partner units in        Access Midstream Partners.                   \u201cAccess Midstream further enhances our presence in attractive growth        basins, positions us to take advantage of demand growth and the increase        in natural gas supply, and supports our industry-leading dividend growth        strategy,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 chief executive officer. \u201cIn        addition to increasing our footprint with excellent fee-based assets,        we\u2019re fortunate to welcome the talented employees of Access to the        Williams family of companies. The value they bring, especially on the        project execution front, is one of the most compelling benefits of this        acquisition and the proposed merger.\u201d                   As previously announced, Williams is proposing the merger of Williams        Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) with and into Access Midstream Partners, L.P.        Williams is proposing that the entities merge in a unit-for-unit        exchange at a ratio of 0.85 Access Midstream Partners units per Williams        Partners unit. The proposal also includes an option for Williams        Partners unitholders to take either a one-time special payment of $0.81        per unit, or an equivalent value of additional common units of Access        Midstream Partners, to compensate for a lower expected per-unit LP cash        distribution in 2015.                   Assuming the merger is completed in 2014, the merged MLP is expected to        have a 2015 distribution increase of at least 25 percent above Access        Midstream Partners\u2019 current guidance of $2.79 per unit, which represents        an increase of more than 40 percent above current 2014 distribution        guidance. The merged partnership is expected to have a best-in-class        distribution growth rate of 10 to 12 percent annually through 2017,        strong coverage and strong investment-grade ratings. Distribution        coverage is estimated to be approximately 1.2x in 2015 and at or above        1.1x through 2017.                   The proposed merger terms will be subject to negotiation, review and        approval by conflicts committees of each partnership\u2019s full board of        directors as well as approval by each partnership\u2019s board of directors.        The conflicts committees, comprised solely of independent board members,        have retained legal and financial advisors.                   If consummated, the merged MLPs would be named Williams Partners L.P.        and would become one of the largest and fastest-growing MLPs \u2013 with        expected 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion. Williams        expects the merged partnership to be a synergistic combination,        well-positioned to connect the best supplies with the best markets and        benefit from the ongoing energy infrastructure super-cycle.                   \u201cWe now look forward to pursuing the proposed MLP merger and        accelerating Williams\u2019 move to a pure-play GP holding company,\u201d        Armstrong concluded.                    Dividend Increases                    Williams plans to increase its third-quarter 2014 dividend 32 percent to        $0.56, or $2.24 on an annualized basis. In addition to the third-quarter        2014 dividend increase announced June 15, Williams also previously        provided new dividend-growth guidance of approximately 15 percent        annually \u2013 from the higher third-quarter 2014 base \u2013 through 2017 with        planned dividends of approximately $1.96 in 2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82        in 2016, and $3.25 in 2017. The expected quarterly increases in        Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to quarterly approval of the company\u2019s        board of directors.                    Advisors                    UBS Investment Bank, Barclays and Citigroup acted as financial advisors        and Gibson Dunn acted as legal counsel to Williams. Additionally, UBS        Investment Bank, Barclays and Citigroup acted as lead arrangers for the        Williams interim-liquidity facility.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes combined adjusted EBITDA for Williams        Partners and Access Midstream Partners for 2015, which is a non-GAAP        financial measure as defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define adjusted EBITDA as net income        (loss) attributable to the partnership before income tax expense, net        interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, equity earnings        from investments and allowance for equity funds used during        construction, adjusted for equity investments, cash distributions to the        partnership and certain other items management believes affect the        comparability of operating results.                   Access Midstream Partners defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss)        before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and        amortization expense and certain other items management believes affect        the comparability of operating results.

For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        income attributable to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we calculate the ratio of distributable cash        flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio).        This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow relative to        our cash distribution.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA        to the nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP        financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used        by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management        believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective        of the operating performance of the partnership's assets and the cash        that the business is generating. Neither adjusted EBITDA nor        distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the        period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash        flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as        substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with        United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced that the regular quarterly        cash distribution its common unitholders receive has been increased to        $0.9165 per unit.                   The board of directors of the partnership's general partner has approved        the quarterly cash distribution, which is payable on Aug. 8, 2014, to        common unitholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 1.                   The new per-unit amount is a 6.3-percent increase over the partnership's        distribution of $0.8625 per unit that was paid in August 2013. It is        also a 1.33-percent increase over the partnership's previous quarterly        distribution of $0.9045 per unit.                    Second-Quarter Financial Results                    Williams Partners plans to report its second-quarter 2014 financial        results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 30.                   The partnership will host a joint Q&A live webcast with Williams on        Thursday, July 31, at 9:30 a.m. EDT. A limited number of phone lines        will be available at (800) 479-9001. International callers should dial        (719) 325-2199. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast        in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be available        for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com         and  www.williamslp.com .                   This announcement is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees under        Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d). The partnership\u2019s        distributions to foreign investors, which are attributable to income        that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, are subject        to withholding under U.S. law. In light of the uncertainty at the time        of making distributions regarding the portion of any distribution that        is attributable to income that is not effectively connected with a U.S.        trade or business, we treat all of our distributions as attributable to        U.S. operations. Accordingly, the entire amount of the partnership's        distributions to foreign investors is subject to federal income tax        withholding at the highest effective tax rate. Nominees, and not        Williams Partners L.P., are treated as the withholding agents        responsible for withholding on the distributions received by them on        behalf of foreign investors.

(NYSE: WPZ) and its wholly owned subsidiary  Transcontinental        Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC  (Transco) today announced a fully        contracted expansion project designed to deliver 180,000 dekatherms a        day of additional natural gas capacity for local distribution along the        Eastern Seaboard.                   The Garden State Expansion Project consists of additional compression to        provide 180,000 dekatherms of firm natural gas transportation service        and increased reliability to a local gas distribution company along the        New Jersey coast that was affected by Hurricane Sandy. The $150 million        project would provide firm transportation from Transco\u2019s Zone 6 Station        210 Pooling Point in Somerset County, N.J. to a new interconnection on        Transco's Trenton Woodbury Lateral in Burlington County, N.J. Williams        Partners plans to place the project into service in phases with the        first phase in 2016 and the second in 2017, assuming timely receipt of        necessary regulatory approvals.                   The project is in addition to the $4.3 billion in capital expenditures        planned through 2017 on Transco growth projects that Williams Partners        has previously announced. Transco is the nation\u2019s largest and        fastest-growing interstate natural gas transmission pipeline system. It        delivers natural gas to customers through its 10,200-mile pipeline        network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles between South Texas        and New York City. The system is a major provider of cost-effective        natural gas services that reach U.S. markets in 12 Southeast and        Atlantic Seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in New        York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.                   \u201cAs demonstrated by this continued high-level of demand from customers,        Williams Partners is well positioned to serve the growing        electricity-generation and gas distribution needs of markets up and down        the eastern United States,\u201d said Frank Ferazzi, vice president and        general manager of Williams Partners\u2019 Transco system. \u201cGarden State is        another example of vital infrastructure expansions we\u2019re pursuing as a        result of the tremendous market demand we\u2019re seeing from customers for        abundant, clean-burning natural gas.\u201d                   The Rockaway Lateral and Northeast Connector expansions are among        Williams Partners projects currently under construction. These two        projects are designed to increase natural gas delivery capacity to        Brooklyn and Queens this winter. To the south, demand for gas-fired        electric power generation is the primary driver of two more Transco        projects under construction \u2013 Virginia Southside and Mobile Bay South        III \u2013 both designed to provide additional firm natural gas        transportation capacity to growing markets by 2015.                   Williams Partners also has a number of projects progressing through the        regulatory process. In June, Transco filed a certificate application        with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking        authorization to extend the existing Transco pipeline in order to fuel a        new electric power generating facility in Cecil County, Md. The project        is expected to be placed into service by third-quarter 2016.                   Also in June, FERC announced a schedule showing that it expects to issue        in August the environmental assessment for the Leidy Southeast Expansion        project. The project is designed to increase Transco pipeline\u2019s capacity        by 525,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day to serve the growing market        needs along the Atlantic Seaboard by late 2015.                   In February, FERC issued its draft Environment Impact Statement for the        Constitution Pipeline and the company expects FERC to issue the final        Environmental Impact Statement soon. Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC        is owned by subsidiaries of Williams Partners L.P.,  Cabot        Oil & Gas Corporation ,  Piedmont        Natural Gas Company, Inc.  and  WGL        Holdings, Inc.  The 124-mile pipeline project is proposed to connect        domestic natural gas production in northeastern Pennsylvania with        northeastern markets by late 2015 or 2016.                   "},

The quarterly cash distributions discussed in        this release are declared and received in the following quarter, as        these distributions relate to the prior quarter\u2019s cash flow.                   Year-to-date 2014, Williams reported cash distributions from Williams        Partners and Access Midstream Partners of $964 million, a $188 million,        or 24 percent increase from the same period last year.                   For second-quarter 2014, Williams reported $742 million in adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, compared with $644 million in adjusted segment        profit + DD&A in second-quarter 2013. The $98 million increase in        second-quarter adjusted segment profit + DD&A for the quarter was driven        by a $100 million increase in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for        Williams Partners. The Williams Partners increase included $46 million,        or 7 percent, growth in fee-based revenues compared with second-quarter        2013, as well as $52 million in higher Geismar results, partially offset        by lower NGL margins. The Geismar plant remained off-line for the        quarter; however, assumed business interruption insurance proceeds for        the second quarter totaled $138 million and were included in the        calculation of adjusted segment profit + DD&A.                   Year-to-date adjusted segment profit + DD&A was $1.538 billion, compared        with $1.343 billion year-to-date 2013. The $195 million increase in        year-to-date adjusted segment profit + DD&A was driven by a $187 million        increase in adjusted segment profit + DD&A for Williams Partners. The        Williams Partners increase includes $109 million, or 8 percent, growth        in fee-based revenues compared with the year-to-date 2013 period, as        well as $113 million in higher Geismar results, which include the        favorable impacts of the assumed business interruption insurance        proceeds.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations for second-quarter 2014 was        $158 million, or $0.23 per share, compared with $129 million, or $0.19        per share for second-quarter 2013. Year-to-date through June 30,        adjusted income from continuing operations was $348 million, or $0.50        per share, compared with $281 million, or $0.41 per share, for the first        six months of 2013.                   The increases in adjusted income for the quarter were driven by the        growth in Williams Partners fee-based revenues, as well as higher        adjusted Geismar results (including the benefit of assumed business        interruption insurance recoveries), partially offset by lower NGL        margins and higher net interest expense and income tax expense. The        increases in adjusted income for the year-to-date period were driven by        similar factors that drove the quarterly comparison.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted segment profit +        DD&A are non-GAAP measures and reflect the removal of items considered        unrepresentative of ongoing operations and may include assumed business        interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Reconciliations to        the most relevant GAAP measures are attached to this news release.                   Williams reported unaudited second-quarter 2014 net income attributable        to Williams of $103 million, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis,        compared with net income of $142 million, or $0.21 per share on a        diluted basis, for second-quarter 2013.                   The decline in net income during second-quarter 2014 was driven by lower        NGL and olefin margins, as well as $36 million higher net interest        expense associated with recent debt issuances, partially offset by        increased fee-based revenues and lower income tax expense.                   For the first half of 2014, Williams reported net income of $243        million, or $0.35 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income        of $303 million, or $0.44 per share, for the same time period in 2013.                   The decline in net income for the first half of 2014 was primarily due        to $95 million of first-quarter 2014 charges related to the proposed        Bluegrass Pipeline project, as well as $48 million higher net interest        expense. Lower NGL and olefin margins were partially offset by higher        fee-based revenues and insurance recoveries related to the Geismar        incident.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to report that Williams benefited from a 29-percent        increase in second-quarter cash distributions from our two MLP        investments compared with second-quarter 2013 due to the continued rapid        growth in cash flows of Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners.                   \u201cOur recent acquisition of significant additional interests in Access        Midstream Partners, which has extensive natural gas gathering systems in        attractive growth basins, is expected to further enhance our presence in        key regions and deliver immediate and future dividend growth for        Williams' shareholders. We expect the acquisition will also reinforce        Williams' stable, fee-based business model and support our        industry-leading dividend growth strategy.                   \u201cOur proposal to merge Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners        would create the fastest-growing, large midstream MLP that will generate        competitively advantaged investment opportunities for decades to come as        we connect the best shale basins to the best markets.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Access Midstream Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and        Other.                   The Williams Partners segment includes the consolidated results of  Williams        Partners L.P.  (NYSE: WPZ). Prior to July 1, 2014, Access Midstream        Partners included the company\u2019s equity earnings from its 50-percent        interest in privately held Access Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an        approximate 23-percent limited-partner interest in  Access        Midstream Partners, L.P.  (NYSE: ACMP). As a result of our        acquisition of additional ownership interests, periods after July 1,        2014 will include the consolidated results of Access Midstream Partners.        Following the dropdown of Williams\u2019 currently operational Canadian        assets to Williams Partners in February 2014, Williams NGL & Petchem        Services segment is comprised of various developmental-stage projects.        Prior period segment results have been recast to reflect our        contribution of certain Canadian assets to Williams Partners.

  year-to-date 2014 periods consist primarily of assumed business            interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Second quarter            assumed $138 million of business interruption insurance offset by            actual insurance recoveries of $50 million. Year-to-date assumes            $311 million of business interruption insurance offset by actual            insurance recoveries of $175 million. Adjustments to Williams NGL &            Petchem Services for year-to-date 2014 consist primarily of $96            million in charges related to the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline            project.                                                \u00a0                                      Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; natural gas liquids fractionation;        olefins production; and oil transportation.                   Williams received regular quarterly cash distributions of $422 million        from Williams Partners L.P. during second-quarter 2014 and is expected        to receive distributions totaling $431 million in August. There is a        more detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 business results in the        partnership\u2019s second-quarter 2014 financial results news release, also        issued today.                   For second-quarter 2014, Williams Partners reported adjusted segment        profit + DD&A of $719 million, compared with $619 million for        second-quarter 2013.                   The increase in second-quarter adjusted segment profit +DD&A was        primarily due to $52 million in higher Geismar results. The Geismar        plant remained off-line for the quarter; however, assumed business        interruption insurance proceeds for the second quarter totaled $138        million and were included in the calculation of adjusted segment profit        + DD&A. Fee-based revenues increased $46 million, or 7 percent, in        second-quarter 2014 compared with the year-ago period. Additionally, the        2014 period was unfavorably affected by $23 million lower NGL margins.                   Year-to-date through June 30, Williams Partners reported $1.490 billion        in adjusted segment profit + DD&A, compared with $1.303 billion for the        same period in 2013.                   For the first half of 2014, the Williams Partners increase includes $109        million, or 8 percent, growth in fee-based revenues compared with the        year-to-date 2013 period, as well as $113 million in higher Geismar        results, which include the favorable impacts of the assumed business        interruption insurance proceeds.                    Access Midstream Partners                    Access Midstream Partners reported adjusted segment profit + DD&A of $22        million compared with $18 million for second-quarter 2013. Williams        received a regular quarterly distribution of $33 million from Access        Midstream Partners during second-quarter 2014 and is expected to receive        distributions totaling $78 million in August.                   Year-to-date 2014, Access Midstream Partners reported adjusted segment        profit + DD&A of $43 million compared with $35 million for year-to-date        2013. Year-to-date 2014, Williams has received total cash distributions        of $64 million from Access Midstream Partners.                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services                    As previously mentioned, following the dropdown of Williams\u2019 currently        operational Canadian assets to Williams Partners in February 2014,        Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of various        developmental-stage projects in Canada and the Gulf Coast.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported adjusted segment loss + DD&A of        $6 million for second-quarter 2014, compared with a loss of $1 million        for second-quarter 2013.                   For the first half of 2014, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported        adjusted segment loss + DD&A of $11 million, compared with a loss of $3        million for the first half of 2013.                    Guidance                    Williams is affirming previously announced dividend guidance as follows:        Increase its third-quarter 2014 dividend 32 percent to $0.56, or $2.24        on an annualized basis. In addition to the third-quarter 2014 dividend        increase, Williams also is affirming dividend-growth guidance of        approximately 15 percent annually \u2013 from the higher third-quarter 2014        base \u2013 through 2017 with planned dividends of approximately $1.96 in        2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82 in 2016, and $3.25 in 2017. The expected        quarterly increases in Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to quarterly        approval of the company\u2019s board of directors.                   As a result of Williams\u2019 acquisition of additional ownership interests,        the Access Midstream Partners segment will include the consolidated        results of Access Midstream Partners for periods after July 1, 2014.        Williams has adjusted its financial guidance to reflect the additional        ownership in Access Midstream Partners as well as the related        consolidation due to the acquisition effective on July 1, 2014 for        purposes of financial reporting. Williams expects to complete its        preliminary accounting allocation of the purchase price for the        additional interests of Access Midstream Partnership during the third        quarter of 2014. As a result of the accounting method change from the        equity-method to consolidation, in the third quarter Williams expects to        recognize a significant non-cash gain, currently estimated to be in the        range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, related to the required revaluation        of its December 2012 investment in Access Midstream Partners.        Additionally, Williams expects to record a substantially higher level of        depreciation and amortization expense than currently reflected by Access        Midstream Partners associated with Williams\u2019 increased basis in Access        Midstream Partners.                   Williams Partners is lowering its earnings and cash flow guidance and        revising its capital spending guidance for 2014 as a result of delays in        Geismar\u2019s expected in-service date. Williams Partners\u2019 consolidated        earnings, cash flow and capital expenditures guidance for 2015 and 2016        are unchanged.                   Williams Partners expects adjusted profit + DD&A to grow by more than 68        percent for the period 2016 versus 2013. Several key drivers and        assumptions are embedded in this estimate. The largest risks to        achieving this growth in 2014 are:                   a. The timely producer startup of the Gulfstar One project and        Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon project.                   b. The completion and commissioning of new facilities in the Marcellus        producing region along with expected volume growth.                   c. Natural gas and natural gas liquids prices that drive assumed NGL        margins and drilling activities, as well as olefins prices and margins.                   d. Recovery of assumed business interruption insurance proceeds relating        to the Geismar plant outage in 2014.                   e. Geismar restart and ethylene sales commencing in the fourth-quarter        2014.                   The Geismar rebuild and expansion projects are now substantially        complete and the start-up process is planned to be initiated in        September following the installation of certain safety equipment.        Williams Partners is taking these extra precautions to enhance the        safety of our people and the public. Williams Partners is targeting        first ethylene production and sales in October; however, start-up issues        could cause delays. As a result, financial guidance now includes a range        of outcomes for first ethylene production and sales ranging from        mid-October to the end of December 2014. The delay from the previous        expectation of ethylene sales resulted from the recent decision to        install certain safety-related equipment and to provide additional        contingency associated with the startup process. The Geismar rebuild        project capital is expected to increase by approximately $20 million as        a result of the safety modifications.                   Williams Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and        property damage insurance related to the Geismar incident (subject to        deductibles and other limitations). Risks associated with the expected        full recovery of $500 million in insurance proceeds related to the        Geismar incident could result in full-year 2014 distributable cash flow        that is below the guidance range. In the second quarter, the insurers        paid $50 million of the most recent claim-payment request of $200        million and the total insurance receipts to-date are $225 million. The        insurers continue to evaluate Williams Partners\u2019 claims and have        recently raised questions around key assumptions involving our        business-interruption claim. As a result, the insurers have elected to        make a partial payment pending further assessment of these issues.        Williams Partners continues to work with insurers in support of all        claims, as submitted, and is vigorously pursuing collection of the        remaining $275 million insurance limits.                   The assumed expanded plant restart date and repair cost estimate are        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions. The assumed        property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds are also        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions.                   Capital expenditures for Williams included in guidance for 2014 through        2016 were increased by approximately $2.55 billion to reflect the        consolidation of Access Midstream Partners. Additionally, capital        expenditures have been decreased by approximately $565 million to        reflect a shift in capital spending to periods beyond 2016 for        developing Canadian projects in the Williams NGL & Petchem Services        segment. Capital spending for Williams Partners increased in 2014 as a        result of the Geismar expansion project.

Once filed, the document        will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted income from        continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013        that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations and may include assumed business interruption        insurance related to the Geismar plant. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into the company's results        from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Transco is a wholly owned subsidiary of  Williams        Partners, L.P.  (NYSE: WPZ), of which Williams owns controlling        interests and is the general partner.                   The Diamond East Project is being designed to provide up to one billion        cubic feet per day of new natural gas transportation capacity from        receipt points along its Leidy Line in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania and        Luzerne County, Pennsylvania to its Market Pool at Station 210 in Mercer        County, New Jersey where it can provide supply diversity to Transco's        northeast market, including existing Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New        York local distribution companies and power generators.                   Diamond East will consist of additional compression and selected        pipeline loop segments along the existing Transco pipeline corridor.        Although the final capacity, scope and cost of the project will be        determined by the results of the open season, it is anticipated that the        project will include approximately 50 miles of pipeline looping and        horsepower additions at existing Transco compressor facilities. The        capital investment for Diamond East is estimated to be between $500        million to $800 million, depending on customer participation and volume        commitments.                   \"Diamond East is another example of Williams' commitment to add critical        infrastructure that will connect growing Transco markets to abundant,        economically-priced Marcellus production,\" said Rory Miller, senior vice        president of Williams' Atlantic-Gulf Operating Area. \"Unlike competing        projects designed to serve the New Jersey Market Pool, Diamond East is a        cost-effective expansion along an existing Transco corridor.\u201d                   The proposed project will be subject to approval by the Federal Energy        Regulatory Commission and other agencies. For customer inquiries,        contact Jamie Taft at (713) 215-2404.                   Diamond East is in addition to the $3.3 billion in capital expenditures        planned through 2017 on Transco growth projects designed to serve        markets in the Northeast. Transco is the nation\u2019s largest and        fastest-growing interstate natural gas transmission pipeline system. It        delivers natural gas to customers through its 10,200-mile pipeline        network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles between South Texas        and New York City. The system is a major provider of cost-effective        natural gas services that reach U.S. markets in 12 Southeast and        Atlantic Seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in New        York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The $0.56 quarterly dividend, or $2.24 on an annualized basis, is        consistent with Williams\u2019 previously announced plans to increase its        third-quarter 2014 dividend by $0.135, or 32 percent, from the previous        quarterly dividend of $0.425 per share. The sharp increase in the third        quarter dividend resulted from the July 1 acquisition of controlling        interests in Access Midstream Partners as well as the decision to        accelerate a planned shift to a pure play GP holding company.                   The new amount is an increase of $0.193, or 52.9 percent, from the        third-quarter 2013 dividend.

(NYSE:ACMP) held by        Global Infrastructure Partners II (\u201cGIP\u201d) for $5.995 billion in cash. At        the close of trading on Friday, June 13, the 55.1 million LP units had a        market value of $3.6 billion. Upon closing, Williams will own 100        percent of the general partner and 50 percent of the limited partner        interests in Access Midstream Partners. This transaction follows        Williams\u2019 acquisition of its 50 percent GP interest and 23 percent LP        interest in Access Midstream Partners in December 2012. Williams expects        the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2014. Following the        closing of the acquisition, Williams plans to increase its third-quarter        2014 dividend by 32 percent to $0.56 per share.                   Williams also today announced a proposal to merge Williams Partners L.P.        (NYSE:WPZ) with and into Access Midstream Partners.                   \u201cToday, we\u2019re announcing a series of steps designed to amplify the        benefits of our existing relationship with Access Midstream Partners, an        increase in our dividend and the acceleration of Williams\u2019 move to a        pure-play GP holding company of two leading master limited        partnerships,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 chief executive officer.                   \u201cThe proposed merger of Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners,        if consummated, would create an industry-leading, large-scale MLP with        substantial positions across the midstream business \u2013 spanning natural        gas gathering and processing, natural gas transmission pipelines, and        NGL and petchem services. Our positions in these businesses provide        clearly identified growth for the foreseeable future,\u201d Armstrong said.                    The Acquisition of Access Midstream Partners                    The acquisition of the additional interests in Access Midstream Partners        is expected to increase Williams\u2019 cash flow per share as a result of        rapid growth in Access Midstream Partners\u2019 business, which drives        attractive growth in its GP/IDR (incentive distribution rights) and LP        cash-distributions. Williams expects the acquisition to increase        fee-based revenues to more than 80 percent of its gross margin as a        result of Access Midstream Partners\u2019 fee-based revenues.                   Access Midstream Partners\u2019 business growth is driven by expected        production increases in its portfolio of more than 8.3 million acres        under dedication in major shale and unconventional producing areas,        including the Marcellus, Utica, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Barnett,        Mid-continent and Niobrara.                   Williams expects to close the acquisition of GIP\u2019s Access Midstream        Partners interests in the third quarter this year. The closing of the        acquisition is not conditioned upon the consummation of Williams\u2019        proposed merger of Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners.        Closing of the acquisition is subject only to the receipt of regulatory        approvals under provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.                   \u201cOur acquisition of the additional GP and LP interests in Access        Midstream Partners represents a unique, strategic opportunity for        investors, customers and the employees of both Access Midstream Partners        and Williams,\u201d Armstrong continued. \u201cWe expect the acquisition to        deliver immediate and future dividend growth for Williams\u2019 shareholders        and to further enhance our presence in attractive growth basins. In        addition, we expect the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners will        fortify Williams\u2019 stable, fee-based business model and support our        industry-leading dividend growth strategy.\u201d                   Williams plans to fund approximately half of the $5.995 billion        acquisition with equity and the remainder with a combination of        long-term debt, revolver borrowings and cash on hand. The company        expects to repay revolver borrowings with proceeds from the planned        drop-down of its remaining NGL & Petchem Services assets and projects.        In addition, Williams has entered into a backup financing commitment        with respect to a $5.995 billion interim-liquidity facility with UBS        Investment Bank, Barclays and Citigroup that would be available to fund        the acquisition.                   Williams expects to retain its investment-grade credit ratings at two of        the three ratings agencies. The company expects the third agency to        reduce Williams\u2019 credit rating one notch to sub-investment-grade as a        result of the agency\u2019s recently announced proposed change in ratings        methodology for general partners, along with Williams\u2019 plans to        accelerate its move to a GP holding company and the acquisition        announced today. The company expects Williams Partners to retain its        current strong BBB investment-grade credit ratings.                    Dividend Increases                    Williams plans to increase its third-quarter 2014 dividend 32 percent to        $0.56, or $2.24 on an annualized basis. In addition to the third-quarter        2014 dividend increase, Williams also is providing new dividend-growth        guidance of approximately 15 percent annually \u2013 from the higher        third-quarter 2014 base \u2013 through 2017 with planned dividends of        approximately $1.96 in 2014, $2.46 in 2015, $2.82 in 2016, and $3.25 in        2017. The expected quarterly increases in Williams\u2019 dividend are subject        to quarterly approval of the company\u2019s board of directors.                    Accelerated Transformation to Pure-Play GP Holding Company                    To complete Williams\u2019 transition to a pure-play GP holding company,        Williams plans to accelerate the drop-down of its remaining NGL &        Petchem Services assets and projects to late 2014 or early 2015.        Williams expects to have invested approximately $600 million in the        drop-down assets by year-end 2014. This drop-down transaction will be        subject to MLP board conflicts-committee approval.                    Proposed Merger of Access Midstream Partners and Williams Partners                    Williams is proposing the merger of Williams Partners with and into        Access Midstream Partners following the completion of its acquisition of        GIP\u2019s interests in Access Midstream Partners.                   Williams proposes Williams Partners merge in a unit-for-unit exchange at        a ratio of 0.85 Access Midstream Partners units per Williams Partners        unit. The proposal also includes an option for Williams Partners        unitholders to take either a one-time special payment of $0.81 per unit,        or an equivalent value of additional common units of Access Midstream        Partners, to compensate for a lower expected per-unit LP cash        distribution in 2015.                   The proposed merger terms will be subject to negotiation, review and        approval by conflicts committees of each partnership\u2019s board of        directors. The conflicts committees, comprised solely of independent        board members, are expected to retain legal and financial advisors.        Williams expects the proposed merger to be subject to approval by        Williams Partners unitholders.                   If consummated, the merged MLP would be named Williams Partners L.P. and        would become one of the largest and fastest-growing MLPs \u2013 with expected        2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion.                   Williams expects the merged partnership will be a synergistic        combination that is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing energy        infrastructure super-cycle. The company\u2019s operations represent a        strategic, expanding footprint that connects the best supplies with the        best markets.                   The merged MLP would feature large-scale positions across three key        components of the midstream sector, including:                             Natural Gas Pipelines \u2013 Transco, Northwest and Gulfstream represent          the nation\u2019s premier interstate pipeline network. Transco is the          nation\u2019s largest and fastest-growing pipeline system.                         Gathering and Processing \u2013 Large-scale positions in growing          natural-gas supply areas in major shale and unconventional producing          areas, including the Marcellus, Utica, Piceance, Four Corners,          Wyoming, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Barnett, Mid-continent and Niobrara.          Additionally, the business would include oil and natural gas gathering          services in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                         Natural Gas Liquids and Petrochemical Services \u2013 Unique downstream          presence on the Gulf Coast and in western Canada provides          differentiated long-term growth.                           If the merger is completed, it is anticipated that the merged        partnership will be based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Oklahoma City would become        one of the partnership\u2019s major offices, which would also include        Houston, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Calgary.                   Assuming the merger is consummated in 2014, the merged MLP is expected        to have a 2015 distribution increase of at least 25 percent above Access        Midstream Partners\u2019 current guidance of $2.79 per unit, with a        best-in-class distribution growth rate of 10 to 12 percent through 2017        and strong coverage. Distribution coverage is estimated to be        approximately 1.2x in 2015 and at or above 1.1x through 2017.                    Expected Benefits of Proposed Merger to Access Midstream Partners        Unitholders                              Significantly broadened customer base, enhanced business platform,          expanded technical and operational expertise, and additional          opportunities to sustain long-term growth.                         If the proposed merger is consummated in 2014:                                    Expected increase in 2015 distributions of at least 25 percent              above Access Midstream Partners\u2019 current 2015 distribution              guidance. This represents an increase of more than 40 percent              above current 2014 distribution guidance.                                     Expected increase in 2016 distributions of at least 20 percent              above Access Midstream Partners\u2019 current 2016 distribution              guidance.                                     Expected best-in-class 10 to 12 percent annual distribution growth              rate in each 2016 and 2017. Quarterly distributions will be              subject to approval of the merged MLP\u2019s board of directors.                                     Distribution coverage is estimated to be approximately 1.2x in              2015 and at or above 1.1x through 2017.                                               Expected to improve credit ratings to investment-grade levels, which          lowers debt cost and increases access to capital.                         Expected to increase trading liquidity and broaden appeal to investors          as a core MLP holding.                            Expected Benefits of Proposed Merger to Williams Partners Unitholders                              Expected increased scale and diversification with substantial          operating footprint in major supply-growth basins in the United          States, creating one of the most substantial growth platforms in the          industry.                         Significantly broadens customer base, enhances business platform,          expands technical and operational expertise, and drives opportunities          to sustain long-term growth.                         Proposed merger exchange ratio (described above) would provide          unitholders with an expected immediate premium.                         Williams Partners unitholders will receive Access Midstream Partners          units with pro-forma best-in-class distribution growth and significant          cash coverage \u2013 with the combined MLP expected to benefit from          attractive equity valuation.                         Stronger credit profile expected upon integration of Access Midstream          Partners\u2019 100 percent fee-based business.                            Expected Benefits of Proposed Merger to Williams Shareholders                              Provides opportunity to enhance and streamline operations,          business-development, commercial and support capabilities.                         Further simplifies the corporate structure.                         Aligns Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners unitholders.                         Expected to increase efficiency in capital allocation to growth          opportunities.                         Increased growth visibility expected to drive higher Williams          valuation.                            Additional Perspective on Proposed Merger                    \u201cIn addition to creating a unique, large-scale MLP with one of the most        substantial growth platforms in the industry and operations in top        supply-growth basins, the proposed merger of Williams Partners and        Access Midstream Partners is designed to deliver best-in-class        distribution growth with strong coverage and investment-grade credit,\u201d        Armstrong said. \u201cWe expect the proposed merger to deliver value for        investors in Access Midstream Partners, Williams Partners and Williams.                   \u201cOne of the truly compelling benefits of the proposed merger is the        ability to incorporate the experience and expertise of Access Midstream        Partners\u2019 talented employees with our own,\u201d Armstrong continued. \u201cWe        have had unique visibility with respect to Access Midstream Partners\u2019        talented employees since we made our initial investment. The combination        of our teams will enable us to better align resources and seize the        opportunities of the more than $25 billion in potential growth        investments in our business. We look forward to building on the talents        and capabilities across both organizations and maintaining a sizeable        presence in Oklahoma City following the merger.\u201d                    Financial Guidance and Geismar Update                    Williams Partners is lowering its financial guidance for 2014; financial        guidance for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged. The 2014 change is primarily        the result of delays in Geismar\u2019s expected in-service date and increased        construction spending. The updated guidance also reflects various other        changes since the company issued guidance in October 2013.                   \u201cThe strength of Williams Partners\u2019 ongoing business allows us to        preserve the growth reflected in its 2015 and 2016 financial guidance,\u201d        Armstrong said. \u201cWe are lowering the 2014 guidance primarily as a result        of delays and cost increases specific to work to bring the expanded,        rebuilt Geismar facility back into service. We are now targeting late        July for initiation of the startup process.\u201d                   The partnership\u2019s current guidance for its 2014 earnings, distributable        cash flow and capital expenditures are displayed in the following table:                                          Williams Partners Guidance                                \u00a0                               \u00a0                               \u00a0                                2014                                \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                Amounts are in millions except coverage ratio.                                \u00a0                               Low                               \u00a0                               Mid                               \u00a0                               High                                                DCF attributable to partnership ops.

(2) The cash distributions in guidance are on an accrual basis              and reflect an approximate  annual growth rate in              limited partner distributions of 5-7% for 2014.                                                            \u00a0                                     The Geismar plant rebuild and expansion projects are targeted for        initiation of startup in late July. Williams Partners\u2019 financial        guidance assumes ethylene sales commencing in mid-August. The delay from        the previous expectation of startup initiation in late June resulted        from lower than planned construction labor productivity and other        factors on both the rebuild and expansion projects. The Geismar        expansion project capital spending is expected to increase to $715        million, up $65 million from previous guidance, primarily as a result of        such delays.                   Additionally, risks associated with the expected full recovery of $500        million in insurance proceeds related to the Geismar incident could        result in full-year 2014 distributable cash flow that is below the new        guidance range. In May, the insurers approved $50 million of the most        recent claim-payment request of $200 million. Upon receipt of such $50        million, expected in June, the total insurance receipts to date will be        $225 million. The insurers continue to evaluate Williams Partners\u2019        claims and have recently raised questions around key assumptions        involving our business-interruption claim. As a result, the insurers        have elected to make a partial payment pending further assessment of        these issues. Williams Partners continues to work with insurers in        support of all claims, as submitted, and is vigorously pursuing full        payment.                   Williams is maintaining its consolidated financial guidance for 2014 to        2016 within the existing ranges it has previously published \u2013 excluding        the effects of the acquisition and other plans it announced today. The        company expects to update its guidance on July 30, concurrent with its        second-quarter 2014 earnings release, to include the effect of the        acquisition as well as Williams Partners\u2019 updated segment guidance.        Following closing of the purchase of the GIP interests, Williams expects        to consolidate its investment in Access Midstream Partners for purposes        of financial reporting. In connection with this transaction, Williams        expects to receive tax benefits consistent with those recognized by        Williams from its December 2012 initial investment in Access Midstream        Partners.                    Investor Conference Call                    Williams will hold a conference call with investors at 10 a.m. EDT        Monday to discuss the substance of this news release.

Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes combined adjusted EBITDA for Williams        Partners and Access Midstream Partners for 2015, which is a non-GAAP        financial measure as defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define adjusted EBITDA as net income        (loss) attributable to partnership before income tax expense, net        interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, equity earnings        from investments and allowance for equity funds used during        construction, adjusted for equity investments cash distributions to        partnership and certain other items management believes affect the        comparability of operating results.                   Access Midstream Partners defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss)        before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and        amortization expense and certain other items management believes affect        the comparability of operating results.

For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is further adjusted to add        back depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners        L.P.\u2019s results from ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        income attributable to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted EBITDA nor        distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the        period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash        flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as        substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with        United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE:WPZ) advised its unitholders to reference news        issued today by its general partner Williams (NYSE:WMB). The        partnership\u2019s general partner, Williams, today announced a proposal for        Williams Partners to merge with and into  Access        Midstream Partners L.P.  (NYSE:ACMP). As well, Williams Partners        today updated its 2014 financial guidance.                   The proposed merger terms will be subject to negotiation, review and        approval by the conflicts committees of each Williams Partners\u2019 and        Access Midstream Partners\u2019 board of directors. The conflicts committees,        comprised solely of independent board members, are expected to retain        legal and financial advisors. Williams Partners expects the proposed        merger to be subject to approval by its unitholders.                   In addition, Williams today announced it plans to accelerate its        transition to a pure-play general-partner holding company via the        dropdown of its remaining NGL & Petchem Services assets and projects to        Williams Partners or its then-merged successor in late 2014 or early        2015. Williams said it expects to have invested approximately $600        million in the drop-down assets by year-end 2014. The drop-down        transaction will be subject to approval by the conflicts committee of        Williams Partners\u2019 (or its successor\u2019s) board of directors.                    Financial Guidance and Geismar Update                    Williams Partners is lowering its financial guidance for 2014; financial        guidance for 2015 and 2016 are unchanged. The 2014 change is primarily        the result of delays in Geismar\u2019s expected in-service date and increased        construction spending. The updated guidance also reflects various other        changes since the partnership issued guidance in October 2013.                   \u201cThe strength of Williams Partners\u2019 ongoing business allows us to        preserve the growth reflected in its 2015 and 2016 financial guidance,\u201d        said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019        general partner. \u201cWe are lowering the 2014 guidance primarily as a        result of delays and cost increases specific to work to bring the        expanded, rebuilt Geismar facility back into service. We are now        targeting late July for initiation of the startup process.\u201d                   The partnership\u2019s updated guidance for its 2014 earnings, distributable        cash flow and capital expenditures are displayed in the following table:                                          Williams Partners Guidance                                \u00a0                                2014                                                 Amounts are in millions except coverage ratio.                                \u00a0                               Low                               \u00a0                               Mid                               \u00a0                               High                                                DCF attributable to partnership ops.

Reconciliations to the most               relevant measures included in GAAP are attached to this news              release.                                                                           (2) The cash distributions in guidance are on an accrual basis              and reflect an approximate  annual growth rate in              limited partner distributions of 5-7% for 2014.                                                            \u00a0                                     The Geismar plant rebuild and expansion projects are targeted for        initiation of startup in late July. Williams Partners\u2019 financial        guidance assumes ethylene sales commencing in mid-August. The delay from        the previous expectation of startup initiation in late June resulted        from lower than planned construction labor productivity and other        factors on both the rebuild and expansion projects. The Geismar        expansion project capital spending is expected to increase to $715        million, up $65 million from previous guidance, primarily as a result of        such delays.                   Additionally, risks associated with the expected full recovery of $500        million in insurance proceeds related to the Geismar incident could        result in full-year 2014 distributable cash flow that is below the new        guidance range. In May, the insurers approved $50 million of the most        recent claim-payment request of $200 million. Upon receipt of such $50        million, expected in June, the total insurance receipts to date will be        $225 million. The insurers continue to evaluate Williams Partners\u2019        claims and have recently raised questions around key assumptions        involving our business-interruption claim. As a result, the insurers        have elected to make a partial payment pending further assessment of        these issues. Williams Partners continues to work with insurers in        support of all claims, as submitted, and is vigorously pursuing full        payment.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release refers to the financial measures \u2013 adjusted segment        profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, distributable cash flow and cash        distribution coverage ratio \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is further adjusted to add        back depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners        L.P.\u2019s results from ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        income attributable to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A nor distributable cash        flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they        presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

In coordination with regulatory agencies, the company is assessing        damage and developing preliminary plans to bring the other four plants        back into service in a safe, systematic and timely manner. The capacity        of the four undamaged plants totals 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per        day, which is sufficient to handle all of the natural gas currently        available to the facility.                   The facility has been shut down since the incident occurred at        approximately 2 p.m. local time on April 23. There were no reported        injuries or damage to property outside the facility. The plant\u2019s        emergency procedures performed as designed.                   The Opal Gas-Processing Plant has the capacity to process 1.5 billion        cubic feet of natural gas daily via five turbo-expander cryogenic        gas-processing units. Although the company has not yet made a full        assessment of all plant equipment, the initial visual assessment of        damage indicates that the impact was largely limited to a small area of        the TXP-3 unit. At the time of the incident, it was one of the four        units the plant had running to handle recent daily inlet volumes of        approximately 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The fifth unit was        idle, serving as excess capacity for the facility.                   Information from the company\u2019s visual inspection of the damage area        indicates that there was a release of natural gas that was subsequently        ignited. The focus of the investigation will be on the cause of the        release and source of ignition.                   Company personnel are inspecting the damaged equipment in cooperation        with regulatory authorities. The company plans a detailed assessment of        damage, followed by development of plans to address the damaged        equipment.                   The company has insurance, subject to retentions (deductibles), for        property damage and business interruption; it expects the coverage to        mitigate the financial effects of the incident.                   The company is working to address the needs of customers whose business        is affected by the temporary shutdown of operations at the Opal facility.                   "},

The company continues        to engage in discussions with potential customers regarding the scale        and timing of demand for services and the required firm contractual        commitments that would support any future capital investments.

Four cryogenic processing trains are now operating and a fifth unit,        where the fire occurred, remains out of service.                   The total capacity of the four operating trains is sufficient to meet        customer needs. The two units most recently placed back in service,        TXP-4 and TXP-5, have a combined design processing capacity of 700        million cubic feet of gas per day. TXP-4 was idle at the time of the        incident, serving as excess capacity for the facility.

The decline in net income during first-quarter 2014 was primarily due to        $86 million of charges related to the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline        project primarily reflecting the write-off of development costs that        were previously capitalized and other costs that were incurred or        accrued during the first quarter. At Williams Partners, increases in        fee-based revenues more than offset lower natural gas liquids (NGL)        margins.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $190 million, or $0.28        per share, for first-quarter 2014, compared with $152 million or $0.22        per share for first-quarter 2013.                   The $38 million increase in after-tax results attributable to Williams        for the quarter was driven by $63 million growth in Williams Partners\u2019        fee-based revenues, as well as $63 million in higher Geismar results        (including the benefit of expected business interruption insurance        recoveries and planned plant expansion), partially offset by $38 million        lower NGL margins and other changes.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. A reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached        to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWilliams\u2019 core businesses performed well in the first quarter,        generating a 14 percent increase in adjusted segment profit plus DD&A        versus the prior year as we continued our trend of posting significant        quarterly increases in fee-based revenues.                   \u201cFrom an execution perspective, we completed or made significant        progress on several large-scale projects in the first quarter. We added        a second fractionator to our Moundsville, West Virginia facility,        substantially completed the Keathley Canyon deepwater pipeline and        prepared Gulfstar One for commissioning. Additionally, the Geismar        olefins plant is expected to begin the startup of its expanded        production in June.                   \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the accelerating pace of expansion projects at        Transco, including Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Expansion and our newly        announced Gulf Trace project. The Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Trace        projects will serve as important infrastructure for future LNG export        facilities at Cove Point and Sabine Pass.                   \u201cWe believe the Bluegrass Pipeline project remains the best long-term        solution in the marketplace for transporting NGLs from the northeast to        the Gulf Coast and we continue to pursue support for the project.        However, we are exercising financial discipline by suspending capital        expenditures as we seek to secure the necessary customer commitments to        move forward. Williams will focus its capital investments on the large        portfolio of investment opportunities where the returns are more        attractive relative to risks.                   \u201cOur strong performance, steadfast execution and constantly growing        business opportunities give us confidence in our continuing expectation        to grow adjusted segment profit plus DD&A by 50 percent in 2015 versus        2013 with minimal Williams Partners\u2019 equity issuances in 2014 and none        planned for 2015. Growing cash flows are shifting financing toward debt        while we continue to maintain investment grade credit metrics.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services, Access Midstream Partners,        and Other.                   The Williams Partners segment includes the consolidated results of  Williams        Partners L.P.  (NYSE:WPZ). Following the dropdown of Williams\u2019        currently operational Canadian assets to Williams Partners in February        2014, Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of various        developmental-stage projects. Access Midstream Partners includes the        company\u2019s equity earnings from its 50-percent interest in privately held        Access Midstream Partners GP, L.L.C. and an approximate 23-percent        limited-partner interest in  Access        Midstream Partners, L.P.

Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; natural gas liquids fractionation,        storage and transportation; olefins production; and oil transportation.                   For first-quarter 2014, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $503 million, compared with $494 million for first-quarter 2013. The        increase in segment profit is primarily due to an increase in fee-based        revenues, partially offset by lower NGL margins and higher operating        costs (primarily depreciation) associated with ongoing growth in        Williams Partners\u2019 Northeast operations.                   WPZ raised its first-quarter cash distribution by 1.3 percent compared        to the prior quarter.

mentioned, following the dropdown of Williams\u2019 currently        operational Canadian assets to Williams Partners in February 2014,        Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment is comprised of various        developmental-stage projects in Canada and the Gulf Coast.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment loss of $100 million        for first-quarter 2014, compared with segment loss of $2 million for        first-quarter 2013.                   The decline in segment profit during first quarter was primarily due to        charges of $95 million related to the proposed Bluegrass project,        including equity losses associated with the write-off of development        costs at Bluegrass that were previously capitalized and other costs        incurred or accrued during the first quarter.                    Access Midstream Partners                    The first-quarter 2014 segment profit of $6 million for Access Midstream        Partners includes $21 million of equity earnings recognized from Access        Midstream Partners, L.P. reduced by $15 million noncash amortization of        the difference between the cost of Williams\u2019 investment and the        company\u2019s underlying share of the net assets of Access Midstream        Partners, L.P. In the first-quarter of 2014, Williams received a regular        quarterly distribution of $31 million from Access Midstream Partners,        L.P.                   ACMP raised its first-quarter cash distribution by 3.6 percent compared        to the prior quarter.                    Recent Operational Achievements                     Northeast G&P                    Williams Partners steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes in        first-quarter 2014 despite difficult winter weather conditions, reaching        a new monthly average record of 2.3 billion cubic feet per day in the        Utica-Marcellus. Average daily gathered volumes increased 38 percent in        first-quarter 2014 versus first-quarter 2013. The Susquehanna Supply Hub        grew volumes by 37 percent, Ohio Valley Midstream grew volumes by 63        percent and Laurel Mountain grew volumes by 29 percent during the        quarter.                   Williams Partners completed installation of additional fractionation        capacity and is on track to install a de-ethanizer and stabilizer in the        first half of 2014 at Ohio Valley Midstream to keep pace with producer        demand.                    Atlantic-Gulf                    In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Williams Partners positioned the        floating spar and completed the installation of the platform of Gulfstar        One, the first-of-its-kind floating production spar, on schedule to        start serving our deepwater customers in the third quarter of 2014. The        turn-key product, which is part of the partnership\u2019s offshore field        development program, combines production handling services with export        pipeline, oil and gas gathering and processing services.                   In the Gulf of Mexico, Williams Partners completed installation of the        215-mile Keathley Canyon Connector 20-inch deepwater pipeline. The $460        million project, which includes a new shelf platform and an onshore        methanol extraction plant, is due to be completed and ready to receive        production within the fourth quarter of 2014.                   Timely expansions to the Transco pipeline system drove record-breaking        volume deliveries in areas stretching from Mississippi to New York City.        Transco set a three-day delivery record Jan. 6-8, 2014 when it delivered        an average of 11.12 million dekatherms per day.                   Williams Partners announced that the Atlantic Sunrise expansion project        received binding commitments from nine shippers for 100 percent of the        1.7 million dekatherms of daily firm transportation capacity. The        project includes 15-year shipper commitments from producers, local        distribution companies and power generators. Williams Partners expects        to bring Atlantic Sunrise into service in the second half of 2017,        assuming all necessary regulatory approvals are received in a timely        manner.                    West                    The Willow Creek processing plant in the Piceance Basin achieved a new        quarterly average daily inlet volume throughput record of 479 million        cubic feet per day in the first quarter.                    NGL & Petchem Services                    Williams Partners continues to rebuild, turnaround and expand the        Geismar Olefins plant, which is expected to begin startup in the latter        half of June 2014. The expansion will increase the ethylene production        capacity by 600 million pounds per year to a total capacity of 1.95        billion pounds per year. Williams Partners\u2019 share of the total capacity        is approximately 1.7 billion pounds per year.                    Guidance                    The company continues to expect to increase the full-year dividend it        pays shareholders by 20 percent in each 2014 and 2015 \u2013 to per-share        amounts of $1.75 and $2.11, respectively. Williams' full-year dividend        for 2013 was $1.44 per share. The expected quarterly increases in        Williams' dividend are subject to quarterly approval of Williams' board        of directors. Williams has paid a common stock dividend every quarter        since 1974.                   Williams expects strong cash flow growth from Williams Partners and        Access Midstream Partners to drive the cash dividend growth through the        2014 to 2015 guidance period and beyond.                   Williams Partners\u2019 consolidated profitability and cash flow guidance        ranges are unchanged from guidance issued on February 19, 2014. Williams        Partners expects adjusted segment profit + DD&A to grow by nearly 50        percent for 2015 versus 2013. Several key drivers and assumptions are        embedded in this estimate. The largest risks to achieving this growth in        2014 are:                   a. Natural gas and natural gas liquids prices that drive assumed NGL        margins and drilling activities, as well as olefins prices and margins.                   b. Recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds offsetting the        majority of the Geismar plant outage in 2014, which assumes a June        startup.                   c. The timely completion and producer startup of the Gulfstar One        project and Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon System.                   d. The delivery of new facilities in the Marcellus producing region        along with expected volume growth.                   e. The in-service date for Transco\u2019s Rockaway Lateral.                   Williams Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and        property damage insurance related to the Geismar incident (subject to        deductibles and other limitations) that is expected to significantly        mitigate the financial loss. Based on commodity pricing assumptions and        property damage estimates, the company estimates approximately $430        million of cash recoveries from insurers related to business        interruption losses and approximately $70 million related to property        damage. In first-quarter 2014, the insurers paid a second installment of        $125 million and the total amount received to date is $175 million.                   The assumed expanded plant restart date and repair cost estimate are        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions. The assumed        property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds are also        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions.                   Capital expenditures for Williams included in guidance for 2014 and 2015        have been decreased by approximately $1.2 billion due to the elimination        of the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline project. This decrease is offset        somewhat by approximately $250 million of higher estimated capital        expenditures at Williams Partners during this period, which primarily        relates to new projects.                   Williams is removing the proposed Bluegrass project from its financial        guidance and will focus current capital expenditures on the large        portfolio of investment opportunities where the returns are more        attractive relative to risks.

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance.

Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share.

The two units now back in service, TXP-1 and        TXP-2, have a combined design processing capacity of 395 million cubic        feet of gas per day.                   The two other units that were part of the shutdown, TXP-4 and TXP-5,        remain offline as the company works to take the necessary steps to bring        additional portions of the plant into service in a safe, systematic and        timely manner.                   At the time of the incident, the Opal Gas-Processing Plant was        processing daily inlet volumes of approximately 1 billion cubic feet of        natural gas. The capacity of the TXP-1, -2, -4 and -5 plants totals 1.1        billion cubic feet of gas per day, which is sufficient to handle all of        the natural gas currently available to the facility. TXP-4 was idle at        the time of the fire, serving as excess capacity for the facility.                   The initial visual assessment of damage indicates that the impact was        largely limited to a small area of the TXP-3 plant. Information from the        company\u2019s visual inspection of the damage area indicates that there was        a release of natural gas that was subsequently ignited. The company, in        coordination with regulatory agencies, is focusing the investigation on        the cause of the release and source of ignition.                   The entire facility was put in immediate full shutdown when the fire        occurred at approximately 2 p.m. local time on April 23. There were no        reported injuries or damage to property outside the facility. The        plant\u2019s emergency procedures performed as designed.                   The company has insurance, subject to retentions (deductibles), for        property damage and business interruption; it expects the coverage to        mitigate the financial effects of the incident.                   The company is working to address the needs of customers whose business        is affected by the temporary shutdown of operations at the Opal facility.                   "},

The Transco pipeline is the nation\u2019s largest-volume interstate natural        gas pipeline system; it is a major supplier of natural gas to New York        City. Customers in a dozen states along the 1,800-mile pipeline route        spanning South Texas to New York City receive natural gas shipped on the        Transco system.                   \u201cOur execution on the Rockaway Lateral and Northeast Connector        expansions underscore our broader corporate strategy to connect the best        natural gas supplies with the best markets,\u201d said Rory Miller, senior        vice president of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf operating area. \u201cWe        are committed to constructing and operating these projects in a timely,        responsible, environmentally sensitive manner.\u201d                   FERC on May 8 issued certificates granting approval of Transco\u2019s        Rockaway Lateral and Northeast Connector expansions.

We expect residents and building owners        who have upgraded to natural gas heating will continue to enjoy        meaningful savings compared with heating oil.\u201d                   This past winter was a record-setter for Transco, with peak-day delivery        records on three separate occasions. On those days, the demand for        natural gas deliveries on Transco\u2019s system was above and beyond the        peaks that were attributed to the effect of the Polar Vortex and other        brutal cold weather across all of the pipeline\u2019s market areas.                   On Transco\u2019s Rockaway Lateral and Northeast Connector projects, Williams        Partners plans to add 3.2 miles of new Transco pipeline and related        facilities in New York, as well as equipment to increase compression at        three existing Transco facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. With a        daily delivery capacity of 647,000 dekatherms, the Rockaway Lateral will        provide an additional supply-delivery connection into the National Grid        distribution system, which delivers natural gas to 1.25 million        customers in Brooklyn and Queens.                   The Rockaway Lateral and Northeast Connector are among some $5 billion        of energy-infrastructure investments that Williams Partners expects to        make in the Transco system over the 2013 to 2017 time frame to connect        growing market demand with new natural gas supplies.

The Rockaway Lateral is designed to enhance the security and reliability        of supply for Transco\u2019s customer, National Grid. It also increases by        about 10 percent the amount of natural gas that the Transco system can        deliver to National Grid.                   Ahead of the these two projects, Transco\u2019s most recent expansion of        natural gas delivery capacity in the Northeast U.S. came online last        fall, in the early days of the current winter heating season. That        project, the Northeast Supply Link, was Transco\u2019s first major expansion        specifically designed to deliver new natural gas supplies from the        Marcellus production area. In response to demand from customers in        Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, Transco brought half of that        project\u2019s 250,000 dekatherms of daily delivery capacity online three        months ahead of schedule.                   For the Rockaway Lateral, Transco made its initial regulatory filing        with the FERC in March 2009 and last year filed its certificate        applications for both projects.

Leatherstocking is evaluating delivery point locations for local        distribution of natural gas to homes and businesses in Delaware, Otsego        and Susquehanna counties and one tap location that would provide service        to the Amphenol Aerospace Plant in Sidney, N.Y. Last month, the Delaware        County Industrial Development Agency awarded a grant of $750,000 for the        construction of a natural gas pipeline from the proposed Constitution        Pipeline to Amphenol Corporation\u2019s existing facility in Sidney, N.Y., as        well as a new planned manufacturing facility.                   Specific tap locations will be finalized once the pipeline route is        confirmed, currently pending final federal regulatory approval.                   \u201cThe Constitution Pipeline can create a backbone for Leatherstocking Gas        Company to extend the development of local natural gas distribution        franchises in rural communities along the pipeline route in northern        Pennsylvania and southern New York,\u201d said Leatherstocking CEO Mike        German. \u201cWe are excited about the possibilities for local service that        this new pipeline infrastructure can provide.\u201d                   Leatherstocking\u2019s vision encompasses development of local distribution        systems to introduce natural gas service to locations within Broome,        Chenango, Delaware, and Madison counties in New York and Susquehanna        County in Pennsylvania that currently have no such service.        Leatherstocking has franchise agreements in 10 municipalities within        Delaware, Otsego, Chenango and Broome counties in New York. The New York        State Public Service Commission must grant certificates of public        convenience to Leatherstocking in the identified areas before        distribution system development can begin.                   \u201cWe believe working with Leatherstocking is a great opportunity to        potentially provide gas service to communities along the pipeline        route,\u201d said Constitution Pipeline Project Manager Matt Swift. \u201cThe        members of these communities who do not have access to local natural gas        service will greatly benefit from this affordable, U.S.-produced,        cleaner energy resource.\u201d                    Amphenol        Aerospace , a division of Amphenol Corporation, is one of the largest        manufacturers of interconnect products in the world for the military,        commercial aerospace, and industrial markets. Amphenol\u2019s manufacturing        operations were established in the Town of Sidney in 1925 and remain a        major employer in the region.                   \u201cThe accomplishment of affordable and clean energy is a key element in        Amphenol\u2019s ability to compete in today\u2019s global economy,\u201d said Amphenol        Vice President Gary Anderson.                   The availability of local gas service from the proposed delivery taps        represents one of many direct benefits presented by the Constitution        Pipeline project. A study developed by a third-party research firm found        that of the $683 million Constitution Pipeline would spend during the        initial three-year planning and building process, approximately $166        million will directly benefit the five-county region of Susquehanna,        Broome, Delaware, Otsego and Schoharie counties. Once operational, the        pipeline\u2019s economic impact is anticipated to result in about $13 million        in annual property tax revenue. Property taxes, which accrue to        different levels of government in different proportions, are paid to        school districts and local governments. Approximately 60 percent of        taxes paid by this project will go to local school districts along the        pipeline route.                   The Constitution Pipeline project \u2013 which involves the construction of a        30-inch natural gas pipeline from Susquehanna County, Penn., to        Schoharie County, N.Y. \u2013 is currently being reviewed by the Federal        Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In February 2014 the FERC issued        the draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed project,        concluding that environmental impacts would be reduced to \u201cless than        significant levels\u201d with the implementation of proposed mitigation        measures by the company and FERC. A final Environmental Impact Statement        is expected this summer. Construction on the pipeline is scheduled to        begin as early as late 2014.                    Constitution Pipeline Company                    Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC is owned by subsidiaries of  Williams        Partners L.P. ,  Cabot        Oil & Gas Corporation ,  Piedmont        Natural Gas Company, Inc. , and  WGL        Holdings, Inc.  The 124-mile pipeline project is proposed to connect        domestic natural gas production in northeastern Pennsylvania with        northeastern markets by late 2015 or 2016.

The Opal facility processes natural gas gathered from wells in the area        in preparation for interstate natural gas pipeline transport. It also        produces natural gas liquids from the natural gas. The Opal plant has an        inlet capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Recent        daily volumes have been approximately 1 billion cubic feet of natural        gas.                   The incident is known to have affected TXP-3, one of the five cryogenic        processing trains that comprise the Opal facility. It is too early to        determine the extent of damage to the facility or a timeline for return        to service.

The decline in net income for 2013 was primarily due to lower natural        gas liquids (NGL) margins at Williams Partners, as well as the absence        of $207 million of income in first-quarter 2012 associated with the sale        of certain of the company\u2019s former Venezuela operations, of which $144        million was recorded within discontinued operations. Full-year results        were also impacted by over six months of lost production at the Williams        Partners\u2019 Geismar olefins plant and $99 million of tax expense on        undistributed foreign earnings related to the planned dropdown of our        Canadian operations to Williams Partners, which is expected to close by        the end of February 2014.                   For fourth-quarter 2013, Williams reported a net loss of $14 million, or        $.02 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income of $149        million, or $0.23 per share, for fourth-quarter 2012.                   The decrease in fourth-quarter 2013 net income was primarily due to        Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar olefins plant being out of service for the        entire fourth quarter and a decrease in NGL margins. The fourth quarter        was also impacted by the previously mentioned $99 million of tax expense        related to the planned Canadian dropdown. These declines were offset by        an increase in fee-based revenues at Williams Partners and increased        equity earnings from Access Midstream Partners.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $559 million, or $0.81        per share, for 2013, compared with $695 million or $1.11 per share for        2012. For fourth-quarter 2013, adjusted income from continuing        operations was $148 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with $160        million, or $0.25 per share for fourth quarter 2012.                   Lower NGL margins at Williams Partners, including the effects of        system-wide ethane rejection, as well as the unmitigated portion of the        Geismar plant outage drove the decline in adjusted income from        continuing operations during 2013. These were partially offset by higher        fee-based revenues and Access Midstream Partners equity earnings in 2013.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. A reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached        to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cIn the face of the past year\u2019s challenges presented by the continued        decline in NGL margins and the significant and tragic Geismar incident,        we continued to focus on significantly growing our fee-based revenues.        This growth was steady throughout 2013 and we expect it to grow even        faster in 2014 and 2015 as we deliver on major projects for our        customers in a safe and reliable manner. We also continued to win        significant new business that will support strong dividend growth for        years to come. We increased our full-year dividend to shareholders by 20        percent and we expect strong cash flow growth from Williams Partners and        Access Midstream Partners to drive this level of annual dividend growth        through the 2014 to 2015 guidance period.                   \u201cLate in 2013, we placed into service a number of important projects and        we expect to place into service approximately $4.5 billion in new growth        projects at the partnership level and an additional $800 million at the        Williams level in 2014 and 2015. We continue growing our gathering and        processing operations to meet producer needs in the Northeast while        following through on a roster of Transco expansions to serve growing        markets along the Eastern Seaboard. In the Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019re on        schedule to bring into service significant deepwater infrastructure that        is well supported by anchor customers and positioned for further upside        as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico accelerates.                   \u201cIn our NGL & Petchem Services business, we are moving the target        in-service timing of the joint-venture Bluegrass Pipeline project to        mid-to-late 2016 to better align with the needs of producers. We        continue to engage in ongoing discussions with potential customers        regarding commitments to this large-scale, integrated solution that        connects Marcellus-Utica natural gas liquids to diverse domestic        markets, fractionation, storage and export facilities in the Gulf Coast.                   \u201cWe continue to see tremendous appetite for additional firm natural gas        transportation capacity from a range of industry participants, as        evidenced by our fully-contracted Atlantic Sunrise project, and we\u2019ve        identified abundant opportunities to help connect the very best supply        basins with the fastest growing markets by building out large-scale,        market-integrated infrastructure,\u201d Armstrong said.

For 2013, Williams Partners reported segment profit of $1.61 billion,        compared with $1.81 billion for 2012. For fourth quarter 2013, Williams        Partners reported segment profit of $342 million, compared with $441        million for fourth quarter 2012.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during 2013 is        primarily due to $297 million, or 39 percent, lower NGLs margins, as        well as the Geismar olefins plant being out of service in the third and        fourth quarters. The decrease was partially offset by a $209 million, or        8 percent, increase in fee-based revenues and by $50 million of        insurance recoveries related to the Geismar incident.

The decline in segment profit during the year and the fourth quarter was        primarily due to a scheduled shutdown for maintenance and tie-in of the        newly constructed and commissioned ethane recovery facilities, as well        as a third-party outage. Additionally, the write-off of $20 million        costs associated with a canceled pipeline project in 2013 contributed to        lower results.                    Access Midstream Partners                    The 2013 segment profit of $61 million for Access Midstream Partners        includes $93 million of equity earnings recognized from Access Midstream        Partners, L.P. reduced by $63 million noncash amortization of the        difference between the cost of Williams\u2019 investment and the company\u2019s        underlying share of the net assets of Access Midstream Partners, L.P.,        as well as noncash gains of $31 million resulting from Access Midstream        Partners\u2019 equity issuances in 2013. These equity issuances resulted in        the dilution of our ownership of limited partnership units from        approximately 24 percent to 23 percent, which is accounted for as though        we sold a portion of our investment. In 2013, Williams received regular        quarterly distributions totaling $93 million from Access Midstream        Partners, L.P.                   ACMP raised its fourth quarter cash distribution by 23.3 percent        compared to the prior year and 3.7 percent compared to the prior quarter.                    Other                    The decline in segment profit for 2013 in the Other segment is primarily        due to the absence of the gain of $53 million recognized in 2012 related        to the 2010 sale of the company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela. This        gain has been excluded from the adjusted segment profit for Other.                    Recent Operational Achievements                     Williams Partners                     Northeast G&P                              Steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes in 2013 reaching a          new monthly average record of 2 billion cubic feet per day in the          Utica-Marcellus. Average daily gathered volumes increased 63 percent          in fourth quarter 2013 versus fourth quarter 2012. The Susquehanna          Supply Hub grew volumes by 70 percent, Ohio Valley Midstream grew          volumes by 40 percent and Laurel Mountain grew volumes by 55 percent          during the year.                         On track to expand fractionation capacity and install de-ethanizer and          stabilizer in the first half of 2014 at Ohio Valley Midstream to keep          pace with producer demand.                            Atlantic-Gulf                              Timely expansions to the  Transco           pipeline system drove record-breaking volume deliveries in areas          stretching from Mississippi to New York City. Transco set a three-day          delivery record Jan.6-8, 2014 when it delivered an average of 11.12          million dekatherms per day.                         Successfully contracted Atlantic Sunrise, a major new Transco          expansion that would provide firm transportation service from various          supply points along Transco\u2019s Leidy Line in Pennsylvania to demand in          the southeast United States. A portion of the project will be jointly          owned by Williams Partners and a third party. Williams Partners\u2019          estimated $2.1 billion investment in the project is subject to Board          approval. Williams Partners expects to bring Atlantic Sunrise into          service in the second half of 2017, assuming all regulatory approvals          are received in a timely manner. Additional details are expected to be          disclosed later this week.                         Placed into service on November 1 the remaining capacity of its          Northeast Supply Link, after bringing half the capacity into service          three months ahead of schedule in response to customer demands. The          $390 million project expands Transco's existing system into the New          York market by 250,000 dekatherms per day.                         Received FERC approval and began preliminary construction work on the          $300 million  Virginia          Southside Expansion , which is designed to provide 270,000          dekatherms per day of incremental, year-round firm natural gas          transportation capacity to North Carolina and a new, gas-fired,          power-generation plant in Virginia in the second half of 2015.                         In the Gulf of Mexico, installation of the 215-mile Keathley Canyon          Connector 20-inch deepwater pipeline is more than 80 percent complete.          The $460 million project, which includes a new shelf platform and an          onshore methanol extraction plant, is due to be completed and ready to          receive production within the fourth quarter of 2014.                         In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, positioned the floating spar and          prepared for installation of the platform of  Gulfstar          One , the first-of-its-kind floating production spar on schedule to          start serving our deepwater customers in the third quarter of 2014.          The turn-key product, which is part of Williams\u2019 new offshore field          development program, combines production handling services with export          pipeline, oil and gas gathering and processing services.                         Received FERC\u2019s draft environmental impact statement in February 2014          regarding the  Constitution          Pipeline  project.                            West                              Placed into service  Northwest          Pipeline\u2019s  South Seattle Lateral expansion on November 1. The $20          million project provides  Puget          Sound Energy  with an additional 64,000 dekatherms per day of          delivery capacity.                         The  Willow          Creek  processing plant in the Piceance Basin achieved a new          quarterly average daily inlet volume throughput record of 467 million          cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.                            Williams Partners NGL & Petchem Services                              Continuing to rebuild, turnaround and expand the Geismar Olefins          plant, which is now expected to be completed and restarted in June          2014. The expansion will increase the ethylene production capacity by          600 million pounds per year to a total capacity of 1.95 billion pounds          per year.                         Completed a truck rack expansion project at the NGL fractionator and          storage facilities near Conway, Kan. The additional loading bay is          helping meet increased demand for propane this heating season.                            Guidance                    The company continues to expect to increase the full-year dividend it        pays shareholders by 20 percent in each 2014 and 2015 \u2013 to per-share        amounts of $1.75 and $2.11, respectively. Williams\u2019 full-year dividend        for 2013 was $1.44 per share. The expected quarterly increases in        Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to quarterly approval of Williams\u2019 board        of directors. Williams has paid a common stock dividend every quarter        since 1974.                   Williams expects strong cash flow growth from Williams Partners and        Access Midstream Partners to drive the cash dividend growth through the        2014 to 2015 guidance period and beyond.                   Williams Partners\u2019 profitability and cash flow guidance ranges are        unchanged from guidance issued on October 30, 2013. Williams Partners        expects adjusted segment profit + DD&A to grow by more than 50 percent        for the 2013 versus 2015 guidance period. Several key drivers and        assumptions are embedded in this estimate. The largest risks to        achieving this growth in 2014 are:                   a. Natural gas and natural gas liquids prices that drive assumed NGL        margins and drilling activities, as well as olefins prices and margins.                   b. Recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds offsetting the        majority of the Geismar plant outage in 2014, which assumes a June        startup.                   c. The timely completion and producer startup of the Gulfstar One        project and Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon System.                   d. The delivery of new facilities in the Marcellus producing region        along with expected volume growth.                   e. The in-service date for Transco\u2019s Rockaway Lateral.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant is expected to be out of service until        June 2014. The expected delay in returning the plant to service resulted        from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities        (primarily steam and electrical systems) severely damaged in the        incident; lower than expected productivity due to congestion and        complexity from temporary utility equipment impacting both the rebuild        and expansion efforts; and restrictions in work-area access due to        extensive clean-up procedures. Concurrently, the company is implementing        additional systems and processes while conducting the necessary training        to support the safe start-up and continued reliable operation of the        facility.                   Williams Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and        property damage insurance related to this event (subject to deductibles        and other limitations) that is expected to significantly mitigate the        financial loss. Based on current commodity pricing assumptions and        property damage estimates, the company currently estimates approximately        $430 million of cash recoveries from insurers related to business        interruption losses and approximately $70 million related to property        damage. The company\u2019s current estimate of uninsured business        interruption loss, property damage loss and other losses totals $83        million, of which $73 million occurred in 2013 and $10 million in 2014.        A $50 million payment from insurers was received during the third        quarter of 2013.\u00a0In February 2014, insurers agreed to pay a second        installment of $125 million with funds expected to be received in the        first quarter.                   The assumed expanded plant restart date and repair cost estimate are        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions. The assumed        property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds are also        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions.                   Capital expenditures for Williams included in guidance for 2014 and 2015        have been decreased by approximately $500 million. Included in this        decrease is a reduction of approximately $1.4 billion in Williams NGL &        Petchem Services segment primarily due to a change in the target        in-service date of the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline and a shift in        certain Canada projects to Williams Partners (following the dropdown).        This decrease is significantly offset by approximately $900 million of        higher estimated capital expenditures at Williams Partners during this        period, which primarily relates to new projects.                   Regarding the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline, the updated target in-service        date \u2013 to mid-to-late 2016 vs. late 2015 \u2013 is designed to better align        with the needs of producers. The new timeframe is more consistent with        evolving market conditions as the Bluegrass Pipeline project continues        ongoing discussions with potential customers regarding commitments to        the pipeline, fractionation, storage and export services. Completion of        this project is subject to all necessary or required approvals,        elections, and actions, as well as execution of formal customer        commitments.

The package will include the data book and analyst package.                   Williams and Williams Partners L.P. will host a joint Q&A live webcast        on Thursday, Feb. 20, at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines        will be available at (888) 329-8905. International callers should dial        (719) 325-2301. A link to the live year-end webcast, as well as replays        of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will        be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com         and  www.williamslp.com .                    Form 10-K                    The company plans to file its 2013 Form 10-K with the Securities and        Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be        available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted income from        continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013        that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations. Management believes these measures provide investors        meaningful insight into the company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE: WPZ) announced unaudited 2013 net income of        $1.07 billion, or $1.45 per common limited-partner unit, compared with        2012 net income of $1.23 billion, or $1.89 per common limited-partner        unit.                   The $165 million decrease in 2013 net income was primarily due to $297        million or 39 percent lower natural gas liquid (NGL) margins as well as        lost production at the Geismar olefins plant in the third and fourth        quarters. The decrease was partially offset by a $209 million, or 8        percent, increase in fee-based revenues and by $50 million of initial        insurance recoveries related to the Geismar incident.                   For fourth-quarter 2013, Williams Partners reported net income of $211        million, or $0.12 per common limited-partner unit, compared with $291        million, or $0.42 per common limited-partner unit, for fourth-quarter        2012.                   The $80 million decrease in fourth-quarter net income was primarily due        to $77 million in lost production at the Geismar olefins plant as well        as $43 million or 28 percent lower NGL margins. In addition, certain        settlement resolutions and higher operating costs related to our rapidly        growing Northeast G&P segment reduced net income. The decrease was        offset by a $58 million, or 8 percent, increase in fee-based revenues as        well as the absence of allocated reorganization-related costs in 2012.                   There is a more detailed analysis of the partnership\u2019s businesses later        in this news release. Prior-period results throughout this release have        been recast to include the results of the Geismar olefins production        facility acquired from Williams in November 2012 and to reflect the        revised segment reporting resulting from the organizational        restructuring effective Jan. 1, 2013.                    Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions                    For 2013, Williams Partners generated $1.77 billion in DCF attributable        to partnership operations, compared with $1.49 billion in DCF        attributable to partnership operations in 2012.                   For the fourth quarter of 2013, Williams Partners generated $509 million        in DCF attributable to partnership operations, compared with $405        million for the fourth quarter of 2012.                   The $282 million increase in DCF for the year was driven by growth in        fee-based revenues and lower maintenance capital spending primarily on        lower required pipeline integrity projects and one time maintenance        capital items in 2012 at our regulated entities. Expected business        interruption insurance recoveries related to the Geismar olefin plant        incident contributed $123 million to DCF in 2013, of which $50 million        was received in the third quarter. These factors more than offset $297        million lower NGL margins.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.8925 per unit, a 7.9-percent        increase over the prior year amount. It is also a 1.7-percent increase        over the partnership's third-quarter 2013 distribution of $0.8775 per        unit.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cIn the face of the past year\u2019s challenges presented by the continued        decline in NGL margins and the significant and tragic Geismar incident,        we continued to focus on significantly growing our fee-based revenues.        This growth was steady throughout 2013 and we expect it to grow even        faster in 2014 and 2015 as we deliver on major projects for our        customers in a safe and reliable manner. Our distributable cash flow was        up 19 percent for 2013 and we expect DCF to grow from approximately $800        million to $1.2 billion through the 2015 guidance period. As well, we        were able to grow our distributions by approximately 9 percent and are        reaffirming guidance for annual distribution growth of 6 percent in each        of 2014 and 2015.                   \u201cLate in 2013, the partnership placed into service a number of important        projects and we expect to place into service approximately $4.5 billion        in projects in 2014 and 2015. We continue growing our gathering and        processing operations to meet producer needs in the Northeast while        following through on a roster of Transco expansions to serve growing        markets along the Eastern Seaboard. In the Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019re on        schedule to bring into service significant deepwater infrastructure that        is well supported by anchor customers and positioned for further upside        as the deepwater Gulf of Mexico accelerates.                   \u201cWe continue to see tremendous appetite for additional firm        transportation capacity from a range of industry participants, as        evidenced by our fully-contracted Atlantic Sunrise project, and we\u2019ve        identified abundant opportunities to help connect the very best supply        basins with the fastest growing markets by building out large-scale,        market-integrated infrastructure,\u201d Armstrong said.

midstream gathering and        processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including        Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its        51-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its        47.5-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. Caiman Energy II        owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer Midstream. This segment is in        the early stages of developing large-scale energy infrastructure        solutions for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.                   Northeast G&P reported segment loss of $24 million for 2013, compared        with segment loss of $37 million for 2012. For fourth-quarter 2013,        Northeast G&P reported segment loss of $26 million, compared with        segment loss of $17 million for fourth-quarter 2012.                   For the year, the improved results are primarily due to an increase in        fee revenues driven by significantly higher volumes in the Susquehanna        Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream businesses and improved Laurel        Mountain Midstream equity earnings. For both the year and the fourth        quarter, results reflect higher operating costs including depreciation        associated with this rapidly growing segment as well as certain        settlement resolutions.                    Atlantic-Gulf                    Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a        41-percent interest in the Constitution interstate gas pipeline        development project, which we consolidate. The segment also includes the        partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude        production handling and transportation in the Gulf Coast region. These        operations include a 51-percent interest in the Gulfstar project, a        50-percent interest in Gulfstream and a 60-percent interest in Discovery.                   Atlantic-Gulf reported segment profit of $614 million for 2013, compared        with $574 million for 2012. For fourth-quarter 2013, Atlantic-Gulf        reported segment profit of $166 million, compared with segment profit of        $158 million for fourth-quarter 2012.                   Segment profit for the quarter and the year of 2013 increased primarily        due to higher transportation fee revenues associated with expansion        projects and new transportation rates effective in 2013 for Transco, as        well as lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower NGL margins        and reduced equity earnings from Discovery.                    West                    West includes the partnership\u2019s gathering, processing and treating        operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area, as        well as the Northwest Pipeline interstate gas pipeline system.                   West reported segment profit of $741 million for 2013, compared with        $980 million for 2012. For fourth-quarter 2013, West reported segment        profit of $186 million, compared with segment profit of $207 million for        fourth-quarter 2012.                   Lower segment profit for the year was due to 42 percent lower NGL        margins, including the effects of periods of system-wide ethane        rejection and lower per-unit margins. Lower segment profit for the        fourth quarter was mostly due to lower volumes as a result reduced        ethane recoveries and a customer contract that expired. Decreases for        the year in gathering and processing fee revenues were due to severe        winter weather causing production freeze-offs in the first quarter as        well as declines in production in the Piceance basin and Four Corners        areas. Increased natural gas transportation revenues associated with        Northwest Pipeline\u2019s new rates partially offset these declines.                    NGL & Petchem Services                    NGL & Petchem Services includes the partnership\u2019s energy commodities        marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near        Conway, Kan., a 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline, and an        83.3 percent interest in an olefins production facility in Geismar, La.,        along with a refinery grade propylene splitter and pipelines in the Gulf        Coast region.                   NGL & Petchem Services reported segment profit of $275 million for 2013,        compared with $295 million for 2012. For fourth-quarter 2013, NGL &        Petchem reported segment profit of $16 million, compared with segment        profit of $93 million for fourth-quarter 2012.                   Segment profit for the year declined $20 million primarily due to $92        million lower olefin margins resulting from the extended outage of the        Geismar plant partially offset by $50 million of insurance recoveries        related to the Geismar incident and improved marketing margins. Fourth        quarter results were significantly impacted by the extended outage of        the Geismar plant.                    Recent Operational Achievements for Business Segments                     Williams Partners                     Northeast G&P                              Steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes in 2013 reaching a          new monthly average record of 2 billion cubic feet per day in the          Utica-Marcellus. Average daily gathered volumes increased 63 percent          in fourth quarter 2013 versus fourth quarter 2012. The Susquehanna          Supply Hub grew volumes by 70 percent, Ohio Valley Midstream grew          volumes by 40 percent and Laurel Mountain grew volumes by 55 percent          during the year.                         On track to expand fractionation capacity and install de-ethanizer and          stabilizer in the first half of 2014 at Ohio Valley Midstream to keep          pace with producer demand.                            Atlantic-Gulf                              Timely expansions to the  Transco           pipeline system drove record-breaking volume deliveries in areas          stretching from Mississippi to New York City. Transco set a three-day          delivery record Jan. 6-8, 2014 when it delivered an average of 11.12          million dekatherms per day.                         Successfully contracted Atlantic Sunrise, a major new Transco          expansion that would provide firm transportation service from various          supply points along Transco\u2019s Leidy Line in Pennsylvania to demand          centers in the southeast United States. A portion of the project will          be jointly owned by Williams Partners and a third party. Williams          Partners\u2019 estimated $2.1 billion investment in the project is subject          to final Board approval. Williams Partners expects to bring Atlantic          Sunrise into service in the second half of 2017, assuming all          regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner. Additional          details are expected to be disclosed later this week.                         Placed into service on November 1 the remaining capacity of its          Northeast Supply Link, after bringing half the capacity into service          three months ahead of schedule in response to customer demands. The          $390 million project expands Transco's existing system into the New          York market by 250,000 dekatherms per day.                         Received FERC approval and began preliminary construction work on the          $300 million  Virginia          Southside Expansion , which is designed to provide 270,000          dekatherms per day of incremental, year-round firm natural gas          transportation capacity to North Carolina and a new, gas-fired,          power-generation plant in Virginia in the second half of 2015.                         In the Gulf of Mexico, installation of the 215-mile Keathley Canyon          Connector 20-inch deepwater pipeline is more than 80 percent complete.          The $460 million project, which includes a new shelf platform and an          onshore methanol extraction plant, is due to be completed and ready to          receive production within the fourth quarter of 2014.                         In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, positioned the floating spar and          prepared for installation of the platform of  Gulfstar          One , the first-of-its-kind floating production spar on schedule to          start serving our deepwater customers in the third quarter of 2014.          The turn-key product, which is part of Williams\u2019 new offshore field          development program, combines production handling services with export          pipeline, oil and gas gathering and processing services.                         Received FERC\u2019s draft environmental impact statement in February 2014          regarding the  Constitution          Pipeline  project.                            West                              Placed into service  Northwest          Pipeline\u2019s  South Seattle Lateral expansion on November 1. The $20          million project provides  Puget          Sound Energy  with an additional 64,000 dekatherms per day of          delivery capacity.                         The  Willow          Creek  processing plant in the Piceance Basin achieved a new          quarterly average daily inlet volume throughput record of 467 million          cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.                            NGL & Petchem Services                              Continuing to rebuild, turnaround and expand the Geismar Olefins          plant, which is now expected to be completed and restarted in June          2014. The expansion will increase the ethylene production capacity by          600 million pounds per year to a total capacity of 1.95 billion pounds          per year.                         Completed a truck rack expansion project at the NGL fractionator and          storage facilities near Conway, Kan. The additional loading bay is          helping meet increased demand for propane this heating season.                            Guidance                    Williams Partners\u2019 profitability and cash flow guidance ranges are        unchanged from guidance issued on October 30, 2013.                   Williams Partners is reaffirming its guidance for cash distribution per        limited partner unit growth of 6 percent in each of 2014 and 2015.   Williams        Partners continues to expect DCF for the 2013 versus 2015 guidance        period to increase within a range of $800 million to $1.2 billion.        Several key drivers and assumptions are embedded in this estimate. The        largest risks to achieving this growth in 2014 are:                   a. Natural gas and natural gas liquids prices that drive assumed NGL        margins and drilling activities, as well as olefins prices and margins.                   b. Recovery of business interruption insurance proceeds offsetting the        majority of the Geismar plant outage in 2014, which assumes a June        startup.                   c. The timely project completion and producer startup of the Gulfstar        One project and Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon System.                   d. The delivery of new facilities in the Marcellus producing region        along with expected volume growth.                   e. The in-service date for Transco\u2019s Rockaway Lateral.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant is expected to be out of service until        June 2014. The expected delay in returning the plant to service resulted        from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities        (primarily steam and electrical systems) severely damaged in the        incident; lower than expected productivity due to congestion and        complexity from temporary utility equipment impacting both the rebuild        and expansion efforts; and restrictions in work-area access due to        extensive clean-up procedures. Concurrently, the company is implementing        additional systems and processes while conducting the necessary training        to support the safe start-up and continued reliable operation of the        facility.                   Williams Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and        property damage insurance related to this event (subject to deductibles        and other limitations) that is expected to significantly mitigate the        financial loss. Based on current commodity pricing assumptions and        property damage estimates, the partnership currently estimates        approximately $430 million of cash recoveries from insurers related to        business interruption losses and approximately $70 million related to        property damage. The partnership\u2019s current estimate of uninsured        business interruption loss, property damage loss and other losses totals        $83 million, of which $73 million occurred in 2013 and $10 million is        expected in 2014. A $50 million payment from insurers was received        during the 3rd quarter of 2013.\u00a0In February, the insurers agreed to pay        a second installment of $125 million with funds expected to be received        in the first quarter.                   The assumed expanded plant restart date and repair cost estimate are        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions. The assumed        property damage and business interruption insurance proceeds are also        subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual        results to be materially different from these assumptions.                   Capital expenditures included in guidance for 2014 and 2015 have been        increased by approximately $880 million. The increase includes        approximately $550 million related to new projects. This includes        approximately $400 million in the Atlantic-Gulf segment for the initial        spending on three new projects: Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Expansion and        Gunflint. In the NGL & Petchem Services segment, capital expenditure        increases include approximately $150 million in new projects related to        the Canadian assets to be acquired as well as a $175 million increase in        the estimated cost of the Geismar projects. Capital expenditures        guidance changes also include timing shifts between years and other        various adjustments.                   The Canadian asset dropdown is expected to close at the end of February        2014. The expected dropdown requires approval by the Williams Partners        Conflicts Committee and its Board of Directors as well as the Williams        Board of Directors.

non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most relevant measures              included in GAAP are attached to this news release.                                                             (2) The cash distributions in guidance are on an accrual basis            and reflect an approximate annual growth rate in limited partner            distributions of 6% for each of 2014 and 2015.                                                 (3) Guidance assumes the planned dropdown to Williams Partners of            Williams' currently in-service Canadian assets is completed as            expected by the end of February 2014. The planned dropdown is            subject to successful negotiation of a transaction between Williams            and Williams Partners. Guidance assumes Williams Partners acquires            the Canadian assets by issuing Williams a class of units that do not            pay cash distributions during the guidance period. However, capital            expenditure guidance does not include the planned acquisition of            Williams' Canadian assets as the acquisition price will be            determined by the negotiation between Williams and Williams Partners.                                                \u00a0                                      Year-End Materials to be Posted Shortly, Q&A Webcast Scheduled for        Tomorrow                    Williams Partners\u2019 year-end 2013 financial results will be posted        shortly at  www.williamslp.com .        The information will include the data book and analyst package.                   Williams and Williams Partners L.P. will host a joint Q&A live webcast        on Thursday, Feb. 20, at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines        will be available at (888) 329-8905. International callers should dial        (719) 325-2301. A link to the live year-end webcast, as well as replays        of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will        be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com         and  www.williamslp.com .                    Form 10-K                    The partnership plans to file its 2013 Form 10-K with the Securities and        Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be        available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.                    Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, adjusted segment profit and        adjusted segment profit + DD&A \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is further adjusted to add        back depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners        L.P.'s results from ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        income attributable to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A nor distributable cash        flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they        presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced that its  Transco        pipeline system  received binding commitments from nine shippers for        100 percent of the 1.7 million dekatherms of firm transportation        capacity under its proposed Atlantic Sunrise expansion project. The        project includes 15-year shipper commitments from producers, local        distribution companies and power generators.                   The project represents vital energy infrastructure that would connect        surging, new supplies of natural gas in the Marcellus producing region        in northeastern Pennsylvania with growing demand centers along the        Atlantic Seaboard.                   Williams Partners expects to bring Atlantic Sunrise into service in the        second half of 2017, assuming all necessary regulatory approvals are        received in a timely manner.                   Transco is the nation\u2019s largest-volume interstate natural gas pipeline        system. It delivers natural gas to customers through its 10,200-mile        pipeline network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles between South        Texas and New York City. The system is a major provider of        cost-effective natural gas services that reach U.S. markets in 12        Southeast and Atlantic Seaboard states, including major metropolitan        areas in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.                   The Atlantic Sunrise project adds to the list of vital Transco mainline        expansions, including Leidy Southeast and Virginia Southside. Transco is        pursuing expansions that between 2013 and year-end 2017 are expected to        add more than 50 percent to its system capacity.                   \u201cWe expect to invest some $5 billion over the 2013 to 2017 timeframe in        Transco expansions that represent vital connections between diverse,        surging supplies of domestic natural gas and growing demand centers on        the Eastern Seaboard from New York City to the far Southeast,\u201d said Alan        Armstrong, president and chief executive officer of Williams Partners.        \u201cWe see this significant investment as an early read on Transco\u2019s        continuing growth opportunities. We look forward to working with        shippers to develop this vital energy infrastructure.                   \u201cAlready in this heating season, Transco has set peak-day throughput        records on three separate occasions. The demand for our pipeline        capacity on those peak days was above and beyond the peaks that we could        attribute to weather, even the brutal polar-vortex episodes all of our        markets have endured,\u201d Armstrong said.                   The Atlantic Sunrise project will consist of compression and looping of        the Transco Leidy line in Pennsylvania along with a greenfield pipeline        segment, referred to as the Central Penn Line, connecting the        northeastern Marcellus producing region to the Transco mainline near        Station 195 in southeastern Pennsylvania. The greenfield segment will be        jointly owned by Transco and a third party.                   Williams Partners expects its net investment in the Atlantic Sunrise        project to be approximately $2.1 billion. The preliminary schedule for        project permitting activity begins with Transco\u2019s planned submission in        March of its request to commence the pre-filing process with the Federal        Energy Regulatory Commission. The project is subject to approval by        Williams Partners\u2019 Board of Directors.                   "},

The parties plan to close the transaction on Feb. 28.                   The assets include an oil sands offgas processing plant near Fort        McMurray, approximately 260 miles of NGL and olefins pipelines, as well        as an NGL/olefins fractionation facility and butylene/butane splitter        facility at Redwater. Williams Partners also acquired an in-progress        expansion project at the Redwater facility. The expansion will provide        additional fractionation business to Williams Partners related to        development of offgas processing at the CNRL Horizon upgrader facility        retained by Williams.                   These Canadian operations have unique competitive advantages and        long-term contracts that are expected to produce strong cash flows for        Williams Partners. The operating results are subject to commodity price        fluctuations and are expected to contribute distributable cash flow to        Williams Partners of approximately $135 million to $160 million during        the remaining 10 months of 2014 and $200 million to $240 million in        2015. The acquisition is immediately accretive to Williams Partners and        positions the partnership for future growth in Canada.                   Williams Partners plans to fund the acquisition with the issuance to        Williams of 25.6 million Class D payment-in-kind (PIK) limited-partner        units, $25 million in cash and an increase to the general partner\u2019s        capital account to maintain Williams\u2019 2 percent general-partner        interest. In lieu of cash distributions, the PIK units will receive        quarterly distributions of additional PIK units. All PIK units will be        convertible to common units at a future date no earlier than February        2016. Williams Partners also has an option to issue up to $200 million        of additional PIK units to Williams for funding expansions at the        Redwater facility.                   Williams Partners' Conflicts Committee, consisting wholly of independent        directors and their independent legal and financial advisors,        represented Williams Partners\u2019 interests in the negotiations of this        transaction. Robert W. Baird & Co. advised Williams Partners\u2019 Conflicts        Committee with respect to the transaction.                   Upon conversion of the PIK units, Williams expects to gain increased        distributions from Williams Partners. The increased distributions from        Williams Partners support Williams\u2019 dividend growth strategy. Williams        currently owns approximately 64 percent of Williams Partners, including        the general-partner interest. Barclays advised Williams with respect to        the transaction.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes the financial measure distributable cash        flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under the rules        of the Securities and Exchange Commission. For Williams Partners L.P. we        define distributable cash flow as net income plus depreciation and        amortization and cash distributions from our equity investments less our        earnings from our equity investments, income attributable to        noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital expenditures. We also        adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under omnibus agreements with        Williams and certain other items. Management believes this measure        provides investors meaningful insight into the partnership\u2019s operating        performance and the cash the business is generating. Distributable cash        flow is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, net income        or cash flow from operations. It should not be considered in isolation        or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance        with United States generally accepted accounting principles.                                                             \u00a0                                                Distributable Cash Flow of Williams' Canadian Operations Acquired            by WPZ                                                \u00a0                               \u00a0                               \u00a0                               2014 (10 months)                               \u00a0                               2015                                                Dollars in millions (USD)                                \u00a0                               \u00a0                               Low                               \u00a0                               High                               \u00a0                               Low                               \u00a0                               High                                               Segment Profit                               \u00a0                               \u00a0                               $                               116                                                   \u00a0                               $                               141                                                   \u00a0                               $                               170                                                   \u00a0                               $                               210                                                                   Add: DD&A                                                                                           34                                                                                           34                                                                                           42                                                                                           42                                                                   Less: General Corp.

(NYSE: WPZ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary  Transcontinental        Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC  (Transco) today announced Gulf Trace, a        1.2 million dekatherm per day expansion of the Transco pipeline system        to serve the Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: CQP) Sabine Pass        Liquefaction project being developed in Cameron Parish, La. The Sabine        Pass LNG terminal will connect U.S. natural gas supplies with global LNG        markets.                   Transco has executed an agreement with Sabine Pass Liquefaction L.C. as        the anchor shipper, which provides a transportation contract quantity        that is sufficient to proceed with execution of the Gulf Trace project.        A binding open season to gauge additional market interest in the        expansion is scheduled to conclude on May 8, 2014.                   \u201cGulf Trace is a pivotal project at an extremely important time for        Transco and the U.S. natural gas industry as a whole,\u201d said Rory Miller,        senior vice president of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf operating        area. \u201cGulf Trace is designed to ensure we continue to serve our        existing customers who rely on natural gas from the Gulf Coast, while        adding a very large, long-term market commitment in an area of Transco\u2019s        system that is seeing decreased utilization due to changing gas supply        patterns in the United States.\u201d                   The Sabine Pass LNG export facilities are currently under construction        and scheduled to be completed in phases starting as early as the fourth        quarter of 2015. Once complete, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal will be the        first large-scale LNG export facility in operation in the United States.        Sabine Pass Liquefaction\u2019s project is supported by long-term contacts        with several LNG off-take shippers and is expected to provide LNG for        export to diverse markets overseas.                   The Gulf Trace project will make Transco\u2019s production area mainline and        southwest Louisiana lateral systems bi-directional from Station 65 in        St. Helena Parish, La. to Cameron Parish, La. In addition to the        pipeline reversal, a new, 8-mile 36-inch lateral pipeline and two new        compressor stations are planned in order to provide firm transportation        service to the Sabine Pass LNG facility.                   The estimated project cost for Gulf Trace is approximately $300 million        and the target in-service date is early 2017, subject to timely receipt        of all necessary or required approvals by regulatory bodies, including        the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).                   Unrelated to Gulf Trace, Transco is pursuing several other large-volume        projects to serve growing domestic demand for natural gas. By year-end        2017, Williams Partners expects to add approximately 3.4 million        dekatherms of natural gas transportation capacity from northeast        supplies to high-value growth markets with mainline expansions that        include the Dalton Expansion Project, Atlantic Sunrise, Leidy Southeast,        Virginia Southside and others.                   Transco is already the nation's largest-volume interstate natural gas        pipeline system. It delivers natural gas to customers through its        10,200-mile pipeline network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles        between South Texas and New York City.

The partnership announced the  agreement         on Feb. 26.                   The assets include an oil sands offgas processing plant near Fort        McMurray, approximately 260 miles of NGL and olefins pipelines, as well        as an NGL/olefins fractionation facility and butylene/butane splitter        facility at Redwater. Williams Partners also acquired an in-progress        expansion project at the Redwater facility. The expansion will provide        additional fractionation business to Williams Partners related to        development of offgas processing at the CNRL Horizon upgrader facility        retained by Williams.                   These Canadian operations have unique competitive advantages and        long-term contracts. Williams Partners expects the addition of these        assets via this acquisition will be accretive to distributable cash        flow, on a per-unit basis for the partnership\u2019s unitholders. Williams        Partners funded the acquisition with the issuance to Williams of 25.6        million Class D payment-in-kind (PIK) limited-partner units, $25 million        in cash and an increase to the general partner\u2019s capital account to        maintain Williams\u2019 2 percent general-partner interest.                   Upon conversion of the PIK units, Williams expects to gain increased        distributions from Williams Partners. The increased distributions from        Williams Partners support Williams\u2019 dividend growth strategy. Following        this transaction, Williams owns approximately 66 percent of Williams        Partners, including the general-partner interest.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) announced today that it delivered a record        amount of natural gas on its  Transco         interstate gas pipeline to meet demand driven by recent cold weather in        markets on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. Two recently completed expansions        of Transco increased natural gas transportation capacity by 475,000        dekatherms per day, enabling the record in December.                   The nation\u2019s largest-volume natural gas transmission system, Transco        delivered a record-breaking 10.83 million dekatherms in its Zones 4-6        market area stretching from Mississippi to New York City on Dec. 12. The        new peak-day mark surpasses the previous high of 10.5 million dekatherms        set February 17, 2013 for deliveries to those same markets. Transco also        set a three-day market area delivery record Dec. 10-12, averaging 10.47        million dekatherms per day. The Dec. 12 record volume represents enough        gas to heat nearly 50 million U.S. homes.                   \u201cThis recent record was primarily driven by increased natural gas demand        for home heating by local distribution companies, along with power        generation,\u201d said Frank Ferazzi, vice president & general manager of        Williams\u2019 Transco pipeline. \u201cAs intended, the timely completions this        year of two recent Transco expansion projects are helping meet growing        demand in some of the fastest growing markets in the country.\u201d                   On Nov. 1, Williams Partners placed into full-service its Northeast        Supply Link, after bringing half the capacity into service three months        ahead of schedule in response to customer demands. The project marks the        first major expansion of the Transco natural gas pipeline designed        specifically to connect Marcellus natural gas supply with Northeastern        markets. The expansion provides 250,000 dekatherms per day of        incremental firm natural gas transportation capacity from Marcellus        supplies direct to nearby customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New        York.                   In June, the partnership placed into service the final phase of the        Mid-South Expansion, which when combined with the first phase, provides        an additional 225,000 dekatherms per day of incremental firm natural gas        transportation capacity to growing markets in the Southeast United        States. The project provides service to power generators in North        Carolina and Alabama as well as a local distribution company in Georgia.                   Since 2003, the company has placed into service 21 Transco growth        projects, which have increased the system capacity by about 55 percent.        To meet future demand for firm natural gas transportation capacity,        Williams Partners has previously announced approximately $2.2 billion of        Transco growth projects that are expected to be placed into service        between 2013 and 2017. The expansions, which consist of 11 projects in        nine eastern states, are designed to serve customers\u2019 demand for power        generation, industries and local distribution. Additionally, Transco        received a positive customer response to its recent open season related        to the proposed Atlantic Sunrise Project which would be in addition to        the already contracted and sanctioned expansion projects.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,200-mile pipeline system that transports        natural gas to markets throughout the northeastern and southeastern        United States. Current system capacity is approximately 10.15 million        dekatherms per day which is enough natural gas to serve the equivalent        of more than 42 million homes.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced it has received Federal        Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval to expand  Transco ,        the nation\u2019s largest natural gas pipeline system, to provide service to        a customer\u2019s new, gas-fired, power-generation plant in Virginia. A unit        of  Dominion        (NYSE:D)  plans to construct the 1,358-megawatt facility in Brunswick        County, Va., to replace generating capacity from retiring coal-fired        plants.                   The approximately $300 million  Transco        Virginia Southside Expansion  is designed to provide 270,000        dekatherms per day (dth/d) of incremental transportation capacity in        Virginia and North Carolina by September 2015. Of the total expanded        capacity, more than 90 percent will serve  Dominion        Virginia Power\u2019s new power plant ; the remainder will serve  Piedmont        Natural Gas Company\u2019s (NYSE:PNY)  local-distribution business in        North Carolina.                   The Virginia Southside Expansion is part of $2.2 billion of Transco        growth projects that Williams Partners has previously announced it plans        to bring into service between 2013 and 2017. Together, those projects        are designed to increase Transco system capacity by more than 35        percent. The expansions, which consist of 11 projects   in nine        eastern states, are designed to serve customers\u2019 demand for power        generation, industries and local distribution.                   \u201cOur expansions of Transco over the last decade provide an impressive        track record of our ability to execute on the growth opportunities that        we and our customers create around this premier asset,\u201d said Alan        Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner. \u201cSince 2003, we have invested nearly $2 billion in 21 expansion        projects that have increased Transco\u2019s transportation capacity by 55        percent.                   \u201cThese vital infrastructure expansions connect the sizeable and growing        markets along the Transco system with the new, long-lived natural gas        reserves that the U.S. is blessed to have in abundant supply,\u201d Armstrong        said.                   \u201cFor WPZ unitholders, this Transco expansion is just one example of the        $7 billion to approximately $8 billion of investments in growth projects        we expect to make this year through 2015. Together, these projects are        designed to grow the partnership in a way that continues to emphasize        the foundation that growing fee-for-service revenues provides for the        increased cash distributions we expect to make to our owners \u2013 including        the majority-owner and general partner Williams,\u201d Armstrong said.                   Frank Ferazzi, vice president and general manager of Williams Partners\u2019        Transco system described the project this way: \u201cThe Virginia Southside        Expansion is a great opportunity for us to help these utilities serve        the growing electricity-generation and gas-distribution needs in this        region. We look forward to working with the FERC and all stakeholders to        provide essential natural gas supply access in a manner that is        efficient and takes great care all along the route.\u201d                   The Virginia Southside Expansion is designed to consist of approximately        100 miles of new, 24-inch diameter pipeline extending from the Transco        mainline in Pittsylvania County, Va., and into Halifax, Charlotte,        Mecklenburg, and terminating in Brunswick County, Va. Transco\u2019s plan is        to place the pipe in parallel to its own existing pipeline, alongside        the existing utility corridor. In addition, Transco is adding more than        21,000 horsepower of compression at Station 165 in Pittsylvania County,        Va.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,200-mile pipeline system that transports        natural gas to markets throughout the northeastern and southeastern        United States. Current system capacity is approximately 10.15 million        dth/d, which is enough natural gas to serve the equivalent of more than        42 million homes.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) announced today that its Transco        natural gas pipeline has filed an application with the Federal Energy        Regulatory Commission (FERC) to expand its existing Leidy Line in        northern Pennsylvania and its mainline from New Jersey through Alabama        by 525,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day to serve growing natural        gas markets along the system. The project is fully subscribed by        shippers with long-term contracts.                   This application is made as another major expansion project on the Leidy        Line nears completion. The Northeast Supply Link project expands        Transco\u2019s existing system connecting the Marcellus Shale production        region to the New York market by 250,000 dekatherms per day. Williams        placed a portion of the project\u2019s capacity (125,000 dekatherms per day)        into service in August 2013 and the remaining portion of the $390        million expansion is on schedule to be placed into service in November        2013.                   The Leidy Southeast expansion project is being designed to serve the        growing needs of gas consumers along the Atlantic Seaboard and        throughout the southeastern United States. Once the expansion is        complete in late 2015, the Leidy Southeast project will provide enough        natural gas to serve the equivalent of approximately two million        households.                   \u201cIn addition to Transco drawing on the vast natural gas supplies along        the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent region, Transco\u2019s Leidy Line is        strategically positioned through the heart of one of the most important        natural gas production areas in the country,\u201d said Frank Ferazzi, Vice        President & General Manager of Williams\u2019 Transco pipeline.\u00a0\u201cAs we        continue to execute on these expansion projects we are further        leveraging Transco\u2019s ability to serve some of the fastest growing        markets in the country.\u201d                   The proposed Leidy Southeast project will expand the Leidy Line\u2019s        currently subscribed firm transportation capacity of 1.7 million        dekatherms by about 30 percent. It will provide firm transportation from        various supply points along Transco\u2019s Leidy Line to delivery points        along its mainline system as far south as Transco\u2019s existing Station 85        Zone 4 and 4A Pooling Points in Choctaw County, Alabama.                   The proposed expansion will primarily consist of approximately 30 miles        of new pipe and horsepower addition at existing compressor stations at        various locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, in addition to        existing facility modifications   along its mainline. The        capital cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $610        million.                   Most of the new pipe will be installed either entirely within or        parallel to existing pipeline and utility rights-of-way. All other        compression-related activities will be performed entirely within        existing compressor station facilities. If approved, compressor station        construction would begin in the fall of 2014 with pipeline construction        following in the spring of 2015.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,200-mile pipeline system that provides        natural gas transportation and storage services for markets throughout        the Northeastern and Southeastern United States. Major markets include        New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Atlanta. Transco's        major customers are primarily power generators, local distribution        companies and producers. In the last decade, the company has placed into        service 20 Transco growth projects totaling in excess of $1.8 billion of        capital investment. The current system capacity is approximately 9.9        million dekatherms per day, which is enough natural gas to serve the        equivalent of 42 million homes.                   "},

Phase one of Bluegrass Pipeline is being designed to provide customers        with 200,000 barrels per day of mixed NGLs take-away capacity in Ohio,        West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Phase two would increase capacity to        400,000 barrels per day to meet market demand, primarily by adding        additional liquids pumping capacity. The pipeline would deliver mixed        NGLs from these producing areas to proposed new fractionation and        storage facilities that would have connectivity to petrochemical        facilities and product pipelines along the coasts of Louisiana and        Texas. In addition to these domestic markets, the fractionation and        storage facilities are expected to have connectivity to a proposed new        liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) export terminal that, based on current        market conditions, would offer producers an attractive option for        exporting propane and butane, which represent approximately 30 percent        of the average NGL barrel.                   \u201cWe have seen significant interest from the producer community regarding        the value that the Bluegrass Pipeline can offer the market,\u201d said Jim        Scheel, senior vice president of corporate strategic development at        Williams. \u201cWe have been in discussion with many Utica and Marcellus        Shale producers during the past year and we look forward to additional        customer commitments before the end of this year.\u201d                   \u201cWe believe our project offers a number of well-defined market options,        both domestic and international, that offer attractive netbacks to the        Utica and Marcellus producers,\u201d said John Haynes, senior vice president        and chief commercial officer for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. \u201cWe are        encouraged by our meetings with potential customers and are pleased to        launch this Open Season.\u201d                   The Bluegrass Pipeline project is comprised of three segments:                   1. Construction of a new NGL pipeline from numerous natural gas        processing plants in producing areas in Ohio, West Virginia and        Pennsylvania to an interconnect with Boardwalk's Texas Gas Transmission,        LLC system near Hardinsburg, Ky.                   2. Conversion of a portion of existing pipeline on Texas Gas        Transmission from natural gas service to NGL service from Hardinsburg to        Eunice, La.                   3. Construction of a new NGL pipeline from Eunice, La. to a proposed        large-scale fractionation plant and expanding natural gas liquids        storage facilities in the Lake Charles, La. area.                   The proposed fractionation plant and storage facilities are also a joint        venture project between Williams and Boardwalk that have collectively        been named Moss Lake Fractionation. Williams and Boardwalk also recently        announced a joint venture for the development of a new LPG export        terminal and related facilities near Lake Charles, La. on the Gulf        Coast, named Moss Lake LPG Terminal, to provide customers access to        international markets. The combination of the Bluegrass Pipeline, Moss        Lake Fractionation and Moss Lake LPG Terminal projects offers producers        a comprehensive and flexible market solution for the total barrel of        NGLs.                   By combining new construction with an existing pipeline, Williams and        Boardwalk believe that the Bluegrass Pipeline should be placed into        service and begin serving customers sooner than other options. Williams        and Boardwalk are engaged in comprehensive project development planning        including permitting, public consultation and right-of-way acquisition.        On May 29, Boardwalk filed with FERC the Abandonment Application for the        portion of Texas Gas Transmission that would be converted to NGL        service, and the abandonment process is estimated to be complete in the        second quarter of 2014. Williams and Boardwalk are targeting to place        the project into service in late 2015, assuming the parties determine to        complete the project and all necessary conditions are met.

reconciling income from continuing operations to              adjusted income from continuing operations (non-GAAP measures) is              available at  www.williams.com               and as an attachment to this press release.                                                           \u00a0                                      Williams         (NYSE: WMB) announced unaudited third-quarter 2013 net income        attributable to Williams of $141 million, or $0.20 per share on a        diluted basis, compared with net income of $155 million, or $0.25 per        share on a diluted basis for third-quarter 2012.                   The decrease in third-quarter 2013 net income was primarily due to lower        olefin margins from lost production at Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar        olefins plant. An increase in fee-based revenues at Williams Partners        more than offset a decrease in natural gas liquids (NGL) margins driven        by continued ethane rejection. Lower costs and initial insurance        recoveries related to the Geismar incident also partially offset these        negative impacts during the third quarter.                   For the first nine months of 2013, Williams reported net income of $444        million, or $0.65 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income        of $710 million, or $1.15 per share, for the same time period in 2012.                   The decline in net income for the first nine months of 2013 was        primarily due to lower NGL margins at Williams Partners driven by ethane        rejection, as well as the absence of $207 million of income in        first-quarter 2012 associated with the sale of certain of the company\u2019s        former Venezuela operations, of which $144 million was recorded within        discontinued operations.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations for third-quarter 2013 was        $130 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with $161 million, or $0.25        per share for third-quarter 2012. Year-to-date through Sept. 30,        adjusted income from continuing operations was $411 million, or $0.60        per share, compared with $535 million, or $0.86 per share.                   During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, lower NGL        margins at Williams Partners, including the effects of system-wide        ethane rejection, drove the decline in adjusted income from continuing        operations. Operating costs increased related to growth in businesses        acquired in 2012. Lower olefins margins at Williams Partners also        impacted adjusted results for the third quarter. These were partially        offset by higher fee-based revenues.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. A reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached        to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWilliams performed well in the third quarter. Growth in Williams        Partners\u2019 fee-based business, along with our continued focus on cost        control, more than offset the decline in NGL margins; however, the        downtime at the Geismar plant negatively impacted our results.                   \u201cGiven our diverse foothold in the energy infrastructure space, our        large-scale fee-based assets and the tremendous development        opportunities we\u2019re pursuing, we expect strong cash flow growth from        Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners to drive 20 percent        annual cash dividend growth for the company through 2015.                   \u201cWe remain keenly focused on executing a multi-billion dollar growth        program over the next several years to further expand our capabilities        and connections from supply areas in the Gulf of Mexico, the        Mid-Continent, Canada and Northeast U.S. to growing demand centers        throughout the eastern seaboard and southeast to the Gulf Coast        petrochemical complex, as well as overseas to growing LPG markets.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services, Access Midstream Partners,        and Other.

For third-quarter 2013, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $405 million, compared with $429 million for third-quarter 2012.                   The decrease in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during third-quarter        2013 was primarily due to $77 million lower olefin margins from lost        production at the Geismar olefins plant as well as $49 million lower NGL        margins driven by continued ethane rejection. The decrease was offset by        a $61 million increase in transportation, gathering and processing fee        revenues as well as lower costs in the quarter. Third-quarter 2013 also        benefited from $50 million of income associated with initial insurance        recoveries related to the Geismar incident.                   For Williams Partners\u2019 adjusted segment profit, $35 million of the $50        million of insurance recoveries recognized for GAAP accounting has been        removed, leaving $15 million, which represents the amount of the actual        business interruption claim that has been submitted for the third        quarter. The remaining $35 million will be included in adjusted segment        profit during future periods.                   Year-to-date through Sept. 30, Williams Partners reported $1.26 billion        in segment profit, compared with $1.37 billion for the same period in        2012.                   The year-to-date 2013 decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit was        primarily due to $254 million (or 42 percent) lower NGL margins driven        by ethane rejection, Geismar olefins plant downtime and higher operating        costs associated with businesses acquired in 2012. The decline was        partially offset by $151 million higher transportation and gathering and        processing revenues.

       \u00a0                                      Williams NGL & Petchem Services                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services primarily includes Williams\u2019 midstream        operations in Canada, including an oil sands offgas processing plant        near Fort McMurray, Alberta and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility        and butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater, Alberta. Williams NGL        & Petchem Services also includes the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline, which        is currently in a binding open season with a targeted in-service of late        2015.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment loss of $2 million for        third-quarter 2013, compared with segment profit of $16 million for        third-quarter 2012. Segment profit decreased primarily due to a        scheduled third-quarter 2013 shutdown for maintenance and tie-in of the        ethane recovery project.                   For the first nine months of 2013, Williams NGL & Petchem Services        reported segment profit of $56 million, compared with $72 million for        the same time period of 2012.                   The decrease in segment profit for the first nine months of 2013 was        primarily due to the third quarter shutdown discussed above, partially        offset by higher NGL product margins during the first nine months.                    Access Midstream Partners                    The segment results for Access Midstream Partners in the third quarter        2013 included $22 million of equity earnings recognized from Access        Midstream Partners, L.P., offset by $16 million non-cash amortization of        the difference between the cost of Williams\u2019 investment and the        company\u2019s underlying share of the net assets of Access Midstream        Partners, L.P. During third-quarter 2013, Williams received a regular        quarterly distribution of $22 million from Access Midstream Partners,        L.P.                   For the first nine months of 2013, segment profit includes $57 million        of equity earnings, offset by $48 million noncash amortization of the        difference between the cost of our investment and our underlying share        of the net assets. The year-to-date 2013 results also include a non-cash        $26 million gain resulting from Access Midstream Partners L.P.\u2019s equity        issuance in April 2013. Year-to-date 2013, Williams received three        quarterly distributions totaling $64 million from Access Midstream        Partners, L.P.                    Other                    The decline in segment profit for the first nine months of 2013 in the        Other segment is primarily due to the absence of the gain of $53 million        recognized in 2012 related to the 2010 sale of the company\u2019s Accroven        investment in Venezuela. This gain has been excluded from the adjusted        segment profit for Other.                    Recent Key Operational Achievements                     Williams NGL & Petchem Services                              In Canada, placed new ethane and ethylene extraction capability into          service.                          Williams           and  Boardwalk          Pipeline Partners, LP  executed a joint venture agreement to          continue developing a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) export facility in          the Lake Charles, La. area related to the Bluegrass Pipeline project.          The proposed Moss Lake LPG Terminal would serve tanker ships          transporting LPG to Asian, Latin American and European markets.                         Williams and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP began a binding open          season on Oct. 29 to determine industry commitments to NGL          transportation capacity on the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline from the          Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the petrochemical and export          complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The open season is scheduled to          conclude on Dec. 16, 2013.                            Williams Partners                     Northeast G&P                              Steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes reaching a new          monthly average record of 2.0 Bcf/d in August 2013.                         Continued expanding the Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering system to          keep pace with producer demand.

Laurel Mountain Midstream reached a daily record of 400 MMcf/d in          October.                            Atlantic-Gulf                              Concluded a successful open season on Atlantic Sunrise, a Transco          expansion that would provide firm transportation service from various          supply points along Transco\u2019s Leidy Line in Pennsylvania to Dominion\u2019s          Cove Point Pipeline interconnect located in Fairfax County, Virginia          and south to Alabama.                         Achieved an early in-service date for half (125 Mdt/d) of the capacity          of the Transco Northeast Supply Link project. The remaining portion of          the $390 million expansion is on schedule to be placed into service in          November 2013, expanding Transco's existing system into the New York          market by 250 Mdt/d.                         Filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission          (FERC) to expand Transco\u2019s existing Leidy Line in northern          Pennsylvania and its mainline from New Jersey through Alabama by 525          Mdt/d. The project is fully subscribed by shippers with long-term          contracts.

Williams Partners NGL & Petchem Services                              Executing on a plan to rebuild, turnaround and expand the Geismar          Olefins plant by April 2014, which will increase the ethylene          production capacity by 600 million pounds per year to a total capacity          of 1.935 billion pounds per year.                            Guidance                    In September 2013, Williams paid a regular quarterly dividend of $.36625        per share, which was 17 percent higher than the same period last year        and 3.9 percent higher than the prior quarter.                   The company continues to expect to increase the full-year dividend it        pays shareholders by 20 percent in each 2013, 2014 and 2015 \u2013 to        per-share amounts of $1.44, $1.75 and $2.11, respectively. Williams'        full-year dividend for 2012 was $1.20 per share. The expected quarterly        increases in Williams' dividend are subject to quarterly approval of        Williams' board of directors. Williams has paid a common stock dividend        every quarter since 1974.                   Williams expects strong cash flow growth from Williams Partners and        Access Midstream Partners to drive 20 percent annual cash dividend        growth through the 2013 to 2015 guidance period.                   Williams previously agreed to waive up to $200 million of incentive        distribution rights due to it from Williams Partners to boost the        partnership\u2019s cash coverage for 2013. Accordingly, Williams Partners\u2019        third quarter cash distributions to Williams are being reduced by $90        million of waived incentive distribution rights and the balance of $110        million remains available. The guidance presented below assumes $140        million of the full $200 million will be utilized in conjunction with        the upcoming Williams Partners cash distributions for the third and        fourth quarters of 2013. The IDR waivers provide Williams Partners with        short-term cash distribution support as a large platform of growth        projects moves toward completion and as Geismar returns to operations.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant is expected to be out of service until        April 2014 as a result of the incident on June 13, 2013. Williams        Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and property        damage insurance related to this event (subject to deductibles and other        limitations) that is expected to significantly mitigate the financial        loss. The company\u2019s current estimate of uninsured business interruption        loss, property damage loss and other losses totals $73 million. The        company currently estimates $343 million of cash recoveries from        insurers related to business interruption losses.                   Under generally accepted accounting principles Williams Partners expects        to recognize insurance recovery amounts as income when agreed to in        writing by insurers or paid in cash. As such, Williams Partners L.P.\u2019s        adjusted segment profit has been adjusted to accrue assumed business        interruption insurance recoveries while unadjusted GAAP amounts reflect        estimated timing of written agreements with or cash recoveries from        insurers. GAAP financial guidance assumes a 60-day lag from period of        business interruption loss to related income recognition.                   Williams Partners\u2019 preliminary damage assessment and preliminary repair        plan indicates an estimated cost of $102 million to repair the plant.        Williams Partners expects to complete the plant repairs, turnaround and        expansion and resume operations by April 2014. The assumed expanded        plant restart date and repair cost estimate are subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions. The assumed property damage        and business interruption insurance proceeds are also subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions.                                                             \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                               \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                                       \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                               \u00a0                               \u00a0                                                                                        Williams Partners L.P.

It includes an estimate of property damage of $102 million and BI            insurance proceeds of $343 million and assumes the company completes            the plant repairs, turnaround and expansion and resumes operations            by April 2014. The assumed plant restart date and repair cost            estimate are subject to various uncertainties and risks that could            cause the actual results to be materially different from these            assumptions. The assumed property damage and BI insurance proceeds            are also subject to various uncertainties and risks that could cause            the actual results to be materially different from these            assumptions. Total property damage and BI insurance coverage for            this incident is limited to $500 million.                                                               **For Williams Partners, adjusted segment profit and              distributable cash flow (DCF) are non-GAAP measures.              Reconciliations to the most relevant measures included in GAAP are              provided in Williams Partners' news release.                                                            \u00a0                                     Capital expenditures included in guidance for the full three-year period        have been increased by $105 million with decreases to 2013 and 2015 and        an increase in 2014. The revisions include project timing shifts between        years. The overall capital expenditure increase was primarily driven by        a $200 million increase in the cost estimate to complete the Gulfstar I        Project. Williams Partners has a 51 percent share of the Gulfstar I        Project and as such will bear $102 million of the capital expenditure        increase with the balance funded by a partner in the project.                   Williams Partners is raising its 2013 guidance to reflect an expectation        of improved NGL margins and lower costs. Additionally, the guidance for        Williams Partners earnings has been raised in 2014 and 2015 to reflect        the planned January 2014 drop-down to Williams Partners of Williams\u2019        currently in-service Canadian assets, offset by lower volume growth rate        projections at Ohio Valley Midstream.                   Earnings guidance for Williams NGL & Petchem Services, which currently        includes the planned drop-down assets, has been reduced pursuant to the        anticipated January 2014 transfer of these expected earnings to Williams        Partners. The planned drop-down of Williams\u2019 Canadian assets currently        in-service is subject to successful negotiation of a transaction between        Williams and Williams Partners. The periods of 2013 through 2015 include        a number of other guidance revisions across the company\u2019s operations.

Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted income from        continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013        that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations. Management believes these measures provide investors        meaningful insight into the company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

U.S. Heating Season", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/williams-partners-brings-transco-northeast-supply-link-expansion-full-service", "Textbody": "\n     TULSA, Okla.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) announced today that it placed into        service on Nov. 1 the remaining capacity of its Northeast Supply Link,        after bringing half the capacity into service three months ahead of        schedule in response to customer demands. The project marks the first        major expansion of the Transco natural gas pipeline designed        specifically to connect Marcellus natural gas supply with Northeastern        markets.                   The expansion provides 250,000 dekatherms of incremental firm natural        gas transportation capacity from Marcellus supplies direct to nearby        customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. The total expansion        is delivering enough natural gas to provide service to approximately 1        million homes.                   \u201cNortheast Supply Link is a good example of our focus on bringing        large-scale infrastructure projects into service in a timely manner to        meet our customer requirements,\u201d said Rory Miller, senior vice president        of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf business segment. \u201cWe are currently        executing on approximately $1.5 billion in other natural gas        transportation projects, including our interest in the Constitution        interstate gas pipeline, to provide service to high-value demand centers        in the northeastern United States and all along the eastern seaboard.\u201d                   The $390 million Northeast Supply Link project involved the construction        of about 13 miles of pipe in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, in addition to        existing compressor facility modifications and a new 25,000 horsepower        compressor station in Essex County, N.J. Half of the project\u2019s capacity        was placed into service in August 2013 after Williams Partners received        approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an early        in-service date.                   \u201cWe see tremendous appetite from a wide range of industry participants        for additional firm transportation capacity, particularly along the        Transco system as evidenced recently by the overwhelming response to our        Atlantic Sunrise project open season,\u201d said Miller.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,200-mile system that provides natural gas        transportation and storage services for markets throughout the        Northeastern and Southeastern United States. Major markets include New        York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Charlotte and Atlanta.        Transco's major customers are primarily power generators, local        distribution companies and producers.                   In the last decade, Williams Partners\u2019 Transco and Gulfstream have        placed into service 21 growth projects totaling in excess of $2 billion        of capital investment. With the Northeast Supply Link project now in        service, Transco\u2019s current system capacity is approximately 10.15        million dekatherms per day, which is enough natural gas to serve the        equivalent of more than 42 million homes.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced unaudited second-quarter        2013 net income attributable to Williams Partners L.P. of $256 million,        or $0.31 per common limited-partner unit, compared with net income of        $243 million, or $0.29 per common limited-partner unit for        second-quarter 2012. Prior-period results throughout this release have        been recast to include the results of the Geismar olefins production        facility acquired from Williams in November 2012 and to reflect the        revised segment reporting resulting from the organizational        restructuring effective Jan. 1, 2013.                   The increase in second-quarter net income was primarily due to an        increase in transportation, gathering and processing fee revenues,        higher olefin and marketing margins, and lower general and        administrative expenses. Lower NGL margins and related ethane rejection        substantially reduced net income for the current year quarter. NGL        margins declined 44 percent from the second quarter of 2012 as continued        low ethane prices drove system wide ethane rejection; propane and butane        prices remained at depressed levels. Higher olefin sales prices during        the quarter more than offset lower olefin sales volumes as a result of        the Geismar incident.                   Year-to-date through June 30, Williams Partners reported net income of        $577 million, or $0.81 per common limited-partner unit, compared with        $651 million, or $1.11 per common limited-partner unit, for the first        half of 2012.                   The decline in net income in the first half of 2013 was primarily due to        48 percent lower NGL margins partially offset by higher transportation,        gathering and processing revenues, and higher olefin and marketing        margins.                    Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions                    For second-quarter 2013, Williams Partners generated $387 million in        distributable cash flow attributable to partnership operations, compared        with $293 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations in        second-quarter 2012.                   The increase in DCF was due to the growth of the partnership via the        acquisition of the Gulf Olefins assets in 2012, as well as the increase        in income described above and lower maintenance capital.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.8625 per unit, an 8.8 percent        increase over the prior year amount. It is also a 1.8 percent increase        over the partnership's first-quarter 2013 distribution of $0.8475 per        unit.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to report a solid second quarter due to continued growth        in our growing fee-based business, which more than offset both lower        commodity margins and the impact of downtime at the Geismar facility.                   \u201cAt Geismar, I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress our people have made in        a relatively short amount of time to assess the damage from the incident        and begin mobilizing comprehensive repair and expansion plans to achieve        our April 2014 target in-service date.                   \u201cWe continue to execute on our strategy to grow cash flow by developing        a large portfolio of primarily fee-based projects as demonstrated by        major projects completed and brought into service on time and on budget        in the second quarter, including a major expansion of the Transco        natural gas pipeline in the Southeast U.S. and the installation of our        third train at our Fort Beeler gas-processing complex in the Northeast        U.S.\u201d                    Business Segment Performance                    Beginning with its first-quarter 2013 results, Williams Partners\u2019        operations are reported through four business segments.



G&P                    Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and        processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, including        Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream, as well as its        51-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, and its        47.5-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. This segment is in        the early stages of developing large-scale energy infrastructure        solutions for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.                   Northeast G&P reported segment profit of $12 million for second-quarter        2013, compared with segment loss of $20 million in second-quarter 2012.        Year-to-date through June 30, Northeast G&P reported segment profit of        $3 million, compared with segment loss of $16 million for the first half        of 2012.                   Improved results are primarily due to an increase in fee revenues in the        Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream businesses and higher        Laurel Mountain Midstream equity earnings, partially offset by costs        associated with developing business in the Ohio Valley Midstream system.        Second-quarter 2013 benefitted from the absence of costs incurred in        second quarter 2012 to acquire and transition newly acquired businesses.                    Atlantic-Gulf                    Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline and a        41-percent consolidated interest in the Constitution interstate gas        pipeline development project. The segment also includes the        partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude        production handling and transportation in the Gulf Coast region. These        operations include the partnership\u2019s 51-percent ownership interest in        the Gulfstar development project, as well as its 50-percent equity        investment in the Gulfstream interstate gas pipeline. It also includes a        60-percent equity investment in the Discovery onshore/offshore natural        gas gathering and processing system.                   Atlantic-Gulf reported segment profit of $152 million for second-quarter        2013, compared with $127 million for second-quarter 2012. Year-to-date        through June 30, Atlantic-Gulf reported a segment profit of $311        million, compared with segment profit of $292 million for the first half        of 2012.                   Segment profit for the second quarter and for the first half of 2013        increased primarily due to higher transportation fee revenues and lower        project development costs, partially offset by lower NGL margins.                    West                    West includes the partnership\u2019s gathering, processing and treating        operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area, as        well as the Northwest Pipeline interstate gas pipeline system.                   West reported second-quarter 2013 segment profit of $162 million,        compared with $239 million for second-quarter 2012. Year-to-date through        June 30, West reported a segment profit of $348 million, compared with        segment profit of $550 million for the first half of 2012.                   The lower segment profit during second-quarter 2013 and the first half        of the year was due to lower NGL margins, including the effects of        system-wide ethane rejection and higher natural gas prices. Decreases        for the year-to-date period in gathering and processing fee revenue were        due to severe winter weather causing production freeze-offs in the first        quarter and to declines in production in the Piceance basin area.        Increased natural gas transportation revenues associated with Northwest        Pipeline\u2019s new rates partially offset these declines.                    NGL & Petchem Services                    NGL & Petchem Services includes the partnership\u2019s NGL and natural gas        marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near        Conway, Kan., a 50-percent equity interest in Overland Pass Pipeline,        and an 83.3% interest and operatorship of an olefins production facility        in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade propylene splitter and        pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.                   NGL & Petchem Services reported second-quarter 2013 segment profit of        $77 million, compared with $45 million for second-quarter 2012.        Year-to-date through June 30, NGL & Petchem reported a segment profit of        $197 million, compared with segment profit of $116 million for the first        half of 2012.                   An increase in olefin product margins, primarily ethylene, drove the        increase in segment profit during the second quarter and the first half        of 2013. The higher olefin margins were driven by lower average per-unit        ethane and propane feedstock prices and higher per-unit ethylene prices,        partially offset by lower volumes sold, primarily as a result of the        incident at the Geismar facility on June 13.                    2Q Operational Achievements for Business Segments                     Northeast G&P                              Steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes reaching a new          monthly average record of 1.83 Bcf/d in June 2013. Gathered volumes in          second-quarter 2013 increased 76 percent from second-quarter 2012. As          planned, we placed into service three condensate pump stations in the          second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and four central          receipt points in the first half of 2013.                         Completed the expansion of TXP III, the third turbo-expander at the          Fort Beeler facility, adding 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity during          the second quarter of 2013.                         Expansions to the Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering system continue to          keep pace with Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, which recently announced          it would add a sixth rig in the Marcellus in August 2013.                            Atlantic-Gulf                              Reached an agreement in principle settling all issues in Transco's          rate case.                         Executed another tie-back agreement for Devils Tower with strong          potential for additional tie-back agreements.                         Placed into service the second phase of the Mid-South Expansion,          adding 130,000 dekatherms per day of capacity from Transco's Station          85 to the Cardinal interconnection near Transco's Station 160 in North          Carolina. The partnership placed into service the first phase of the          expansion (95,000 dekatherms per day) in the fall of 2012. The          expansion provides natural gas service to power generators in North          Carolina and Alabama as well as a local distribution company in          Georgia.                         Filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission          (FERC) seeking approval to construct the Constitution Pipeline, a          120-mile pipeline which will connect natural gas production in          northeastern Pennsylvania with northeastern markets by 2015. The          Constitution Pipeline has been designed to transport up to 650,000          dekatherms of natural gas per day (enough natural gas to serve          approximately 3 million homes) from Williams Partners' gathering          system in Susquehanna County, Pa., to the Iroquois Gas Transmission          and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, N.Y.                            West                              Achieved a new quarterly average daily inlet volume throughput record          of 466 MMcf/d at Willow Creek in the second quarter.                            Guidance                    Williams Partners is reaffirming guidance for cash distributions per        limited partner unit to reflect an annual growth rate of 8 percent to 9        percent for 2013 and 6 percent to 8 percent for 2014 and 2015.                   Williams Partners is slightly lowering its 2013 and 2014 guidance for        earnings and distributable cash flow primarily to reflect the expected        financial impact of the Geismar incident as well as expected lower NGL        processing margins. Guidance for 2015 remains unchanged despite expected        lower NGL processing margins.                   Both 2013 and 2014 include a number of other revisions including a        normal reallocation of support costs between the reportable segments.        The primary effect of this reallocation was a shift of support costs to        the Northeast G&P segment as a result of its dramatic growth.                   In May 2013, Williams agreed to waive incentive distribution rights of        up to $200 million over the subsequent four quarters to boost Williams        Partners\u2019 expected cash distribution coverage ratio. The full $200        million remains available; however, the guidance presented below assumes        that the full $200 million will be utilized in conjunction with the        upcoming cash distributions for the third and fourth quarters of 2013.        These IDR waivers provide Williams Partners with short-term cash        distribution support as a large platform of growth projects moves toward        completion and as Geismar returns to operations. Williams Partners        expects a return to stronger coverage ratios in 2014 and beyond as new        projects come into service. Williams Partners expects cash coverage of        .97x in 2014 and 1.02x in 2015 without the benefit of these additional        IDR waivers. The 2014 cash coverage guidance includes expected        recoveries from business interruption insurance related to the Geismar        incident.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant is expected to be out of service until        April 2014 as a result of the incident on June 13, 2013. Williams        Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and property        damage insurance related to this event (subject to deductibles and other        limitations) that is expected to significantly mitigate the financial        loss. The partnership\u2019s current estimate of uninsured business        interruption loss, property damage loss and other losses totals $95        million. The partnership currently estimates $384 million of cash        recoveries from insurers related to business interruption losses.                   Under generally accepted accounting principles Williams Partners expects        to recognize insurance recovery amounts as income when they are agreed        to in writing by insurers or paid in cash. As such, adjusted segment        profit, distributable cash flow and cash coverage have been adjusted to        accrue assumed business interruption insurance recoveries while        unadjusted GAAP amounts reflect estimated timing of written agreements        with or cash recoveries from insurers. GAAP financial guidance assumes a        60 day lag from period of business interruption loss to related income        recognition.                   Williams Partners\u2019 preliminary damage assessment and preliminary repair        plan indicates an estimated cost of $102 million to repair the plant.        The partnership expects to complete the plant repairs, turnaround and        expansion and resume operations by April 2014. The assumed expanded        plant restart date and repair cost estimate are subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions. The assumed property damage        and business interruption insurance proceeds are also subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions.

The information will include the data book and analyst package.                   Williams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on        Thursday, Aug. 1, at 9:30 a.m. EDT. A limited number of phone lines will        be available at (888) 490-2763. International callers should dial (719)        457-2710. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast in        both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be available for        two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com \u00a0and\u00a0 www.williamslp.com .                    Form 10-Q                    The partnership plans to file its second-quarter 2013 Form 10-Q with the        Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document        will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.                    Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, adjusted segment profit and        adjusted segment profit + DD&A \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is further adjusted to add        back depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners        L.P.'s results from ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A nor distributable cash        flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they        presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

www.williams.com         and as an attachment to this press release.                    Williams         (NYSE: WMB) announced unaudited second-quarter 2013 net income        attributable to Williams of $142 million, or $0.21 per share on a        diluted basis, compared with net income of $132 million, or $0.21 per        share on a diluted basis for second-quarter 2012.                   The increase in second-quarter 2013 net income was primarily due to an        increase in fee revenues at Williams Partners that were substantially        offset by lower commodity margins. Williams NGL & Petchem Services\u2019        results improved as a result of higher product sales volumes in Canada.                   For the first half of 2013, Williams reported net income of $303        million, or $0.44 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income        of $555 million, or $0.90 per share, for the same time period in 2012.                   The decline in net income for the first half of 2013 was primarily due        to sharply lower NGL margins and ethane rejection at Williams Partners,        as well as the absence of $207 million of income in first-quarter 2012        associated with the sale of certain of the company\u2019s former Venezuela        operations, of which $144 million was recorded within discontinued        operations.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations for second-quarter 2013 was        $129 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with $138 million, or $0.22        per share for second-quarter 2012. Year-to-date through June 30,        adjusted income from continuing operations was $281 million, or $0.41        per share, compared with $374 million, or $0.61 per share.                   During the second quarter and the first half of 2013, lower NGL margins        at Williams Partners, including the effects of system-wide ethane        rejection, drove the decline in adjusted income from continuing        operations. Costs increased related to growth in the business and        acquisitions in 2012. These were partially offset by higher fee-based        revenues and higher olefins production margins.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. A reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached        to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to report a solid second quarter primarily due to        continued growth in our fee-based business, which more than offset both        lower commodity margins and the impact of downtime at the Geismar        facility.                   \u201cAt Geismar, I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress our people have made in        a relatively short amount of time to assess the damage from the incident        and begin mobilizing comprehensive repair and expansion plans to achieve        our April 2014 target in-service date.                   \u201cElsewhere in our business, we continue to execute on our strategy to        grow cash flow by developing a large portfolio of primarily fee-based        projects at Williams Partners as demonstrated by major projects        completed and brought into service on time and on budget in the second        quarter. Those newly in-service projects include a major expansion of        the Transco natural gas pipeline in the Southeast U.S. and the        installation of our third train at our Fort Beeler gas-processing        complex in the Northeast U.S.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services, Access Midstream Partners,        and Other.

Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; natural gas liquids fractionation;        olefins production; and oil transportation.                   For second-quarter 2013, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $403 million, compared with $391 million for second-quarter 2012.                   The increase in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during second-quarter        2013 is primarily due to an increase in transportation, gathering and        processing fee revenues and higher olefin and marketing margins. Lower        NGL margins substantially offset these gains.                   Year-to-date through June 30, Williams Partners reported $859 million in        segment profit, compared with $942 million for the same period in 2012.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit for the first half of        the year is primarily due to a decline in NGL margins and increased        operating costs. Higher fee revenues and higher olefin margins,        particularly higher ethylene margins at Geismar, helped mitigate the        impact of the lower NGL margins and the operating costs, despite the        impact of Geismar downtime in June.

Services                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services primarily includes Williams\u2019 midstream        operations in Canada, including an oil sands offgas processing plant        near Fort McMurray, Alberta and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility        and butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater, Alberta. Williams NGL        & Petchem Services also includes Bluegrass Pipeline.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment profit of $22 million        for second-quarter 2013, compared with $16 million for second-quarter        2012.                   Segment profit increased primarily due to higher NGL product margins in        Canada primarily from higher sales volumes, as a result of the absence        of the impact of filling the Boreal Pipeline, which occurred in June        2012. This increase in segment profit was partially offset by higher        operating and maintenance costs.                   For the first half of 2013, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported        segment profit of $58 million, compared with $56 million for the first        half of 2012.                   The slight increase in segment profit for the first half of 2013 was        primarily due to higher NGL product margins from higher sales volumes,        offset by lower average per-unit margins and higher operating and        maintenance costs.                    Access Midstream Partners                    The segment results for Access Midstream Partners in the second quarter        2013 included $18 million of equity earnings recognized from Access        Midstream Partners, L.P., offset by $15 million non-cash amortization of        the difference between the cost of Williams\u2019 investment and the        company\u2019s underlying share of the net assets of Access Midstream        Partners, L.P.                   In addition, segment profit in the second quarter of 2013 includes a        non-cash gain of $26 million resulting from Access Midstream Partners,        L.P.\u2019s equity issuance in April 2013. Access Midstream Partners, L.P.        reported second-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $207 million, up 71.1 percent        from second-quarter 2012. During second-quarter 2013, Williams received        a regular quarterly distribution of $22 million from Access Midstream        Partners, L.P.                   For the first half of 2013, segment profit includes $35 million of        equity earnings, offset by $32 million noncash amortization of the        difference between the cost of our investment and our underlying share        of the net assets. The year-to-date 2013 results also include the $26        million gain resulting from Access Midstream Partners L.P.\u2019s equity        issuance.                    Other                    The decline in segment profit for the first half of 2013 in the Other        segment is primarily due to the absence of the gain of $53 million        recognized in 2012 related to the 2010 sale of the company\u2019s Accroven        investment in Venezuela. This gain has been excluded from the adjusted        segment profit for Other.                    2Q Key Operational Achievements                     Williams NGL & Petchem Services                               Williams           and  Boardwalk          Pipeline Partners, LP  executed a joint venture agreement to pursue          development of the Bluegrass Pipeline as well as related NGL          fractionation and storage. The Bluegrass Pipeline will transport          natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the          rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complex on the U.S. Gulf          Coast, as well as the developing petrochemical market in the Northeast          U.S. In June, the Williams\u2019 board approved the project.                            Williams Partners                     Northeast G&P                              Steadily increased the Northeast gathered volumes reaching a new          monthly average record of 1.83 Bcf/d in June 2013. Gathered volumes in          second-quarter 2013 increased 76 percent from second-quarter 2012. As          planned, we placed into service three condensate pump stations in the          second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and four central          receipt points in the first half of 2013.                         Completed the expansion of TXP III, the third turbo-expander at the          Fort Beeler facility, adding 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity during          the second quarter of 2013.                         Expansions to the Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering system continues to          keep pace with Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, which recently announced          it would add a sixth rig in the Marcellus in August 2013.                            Atlantic-Gulf                              Reached an agreement in principle settling all issues in Transco's          rate case.                         Executed another tie-back agreement for Devils Tower with strong          potential for additional tie-back agreements.                         Placed into service the second phase of the Mid-South Expansion,          adding 130,000 dekatherms per day of capacity from Transco's Station          85 to the Cardinal interconnection near Transco's Station 160 in North          Carolina. The company placed into service the first phase of the          expansion (95,000 dekatherms per day) in the fall of 2012. The          expansion provides natural gas service to power generators in North          Carolina and Alabama as well as a local distribution company in          Georgia.                         Filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission          (FERC) seeking approval to construct the Constitution Pipeline, a          120-mile pipeline which will connect natural gas production in          northeastern Pennsylvania with northeastern markets by 2015. The          Constitution Pipeline has been designed to transport up to 650,000          dekatherms of natural gas per day (enough natural gas to serve          approximately 3 million homes) from Williams Partners' gathering          system in Susquehanna County, Pa., to the Iroquois Gas Transmission          and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, N.Y.                            West                              Achieved a new quarterly average daily inlet volume throughput record          of 466 MMcf/d at Willow Creek in the second quarter.                            Guidance                    The company continues to expect to increase the full-year dividend it        pays shareholders by 20 percent in each 2013, 2014 and 2015 \u2013 to        per-share amounts of $1.44, $1.75 and $2.11, respectively. Williams'        full-year dividend for 2012 was $1.20 per share. The expected quarterly        increases in Williams' dividend are subject to quarterly approval of        Williams' board of directors. Williams has paid a common stock dividend        every quarter since 1974.                   Williams expects strong cash flow growth from Williams Partners,        Williams NGL & Petchem Services and Access Midstream Partners to drive        20 percent annual cash dividend growth.                   Williams previously agreed to waive incentive distribution rights of up        to $200 million. Williams\u2019 support is expected to boost Williams        Partners cash coverage for 2013. Due to Williams Partners\u2019 strong        second-quarter performance, none of the $200 million has been waived        to-date; however, the guidance presented below assumes that the full        $200 million will be utilized in conjunction with the upcoming Williams        Partners cash distributions for the third and fourth quarters of 2013.        The IDR waivers provide Williams Partners with short-term cash        distribution support as a large platform of growth projects moves toward        completion and as Geismar returns to operations.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Geismar plant is expected to be out of service until        April 2014 as a result of the incident on June 13, 2013. Williams        Partners has $500 million of combined business interruption and property        damage insurance related to this event (subject to deductibles and other        limitations) that is expected to significantly mitigate the financial        loss. The company\u2019s current estimate of uninsured business interruption        loss, property damage loss and other losses totals $95 million. The        company currently estimates $384 million of cash recoveries from        insurers related to business interruption losses.                   Under generally accepted accounting principles we expect to recognize        insurance recovery amounts as income when agreed to in writing by        insurers or paid in cash. As such, Williams Partners L.P.\u2019s adjusted        segment profit, distributable cash flow and cash coverage have been        adjusted to accrue assumed business interruption insurance recoveries        while unadjusted GAAP amounts reflect estimated timing of written        agreements with or cash recoveries from insurers. GAAP financial        guidance assumes a 60 day lag from period of business interruption loss        to related income recognition.                   Williams Partners\u2019 preliminary damage assessment and preliminary repair        plan indicates an estimated cost of $102 million to repair the plant.        The company expects to complete the plant repairs, turnaround and        expansion and resume operations by April 2014. The assumed expanded        plant restart date and repair cost estimate are subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions. The assumed property damage        and business interruption insurance proceeds are also subject to various        uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to be        materially different from these assumptions.

Includes an        estimate of BI proceeds based on an assumption that the plant resumes        operations April 2014. BI proceeds and related income recognition are        assumed to lag actual realized business losses.                     **For Williams Partners, adjusted segment profit and distributable        cash flow (DCF) are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most        relevant measures included in GAAP are provided in William Partners        L.P.'s news release.                    Capital expenditures included in guidance have been adjusted to reflect        the addition of the Bluegrass Pipeline as well as related fractionation        and storage. The expected capital expenditures (included at our expected        50% ownership share) are reflected in the Williams NGL & Petchem Service        segment in the guidance table below. Capital expenditure guidance has        also been revised to reflect a number of timing shifts and other changes        within the guidance period for several of Williams Partners\u2019 previously        announced projects. Finally, for the Williams NGL & Petchem Services        segment, guidance has been updated to reflect changes related to the        development timing of the Canadian PDH project.                   Williams Partners is slightly lowering its 2013 and 2014 guidance for        earnings and distributable cash flow primarily to reflect the expected        financial impact of the Geismar incident as well as expected lower NGL        processing margins. Guidance for 2015 remains unchanged despite expected        lower NGL processing margins.

Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.                   This press release also includes adjusted EBITDA for Access Midstream        Partners, LP that is a non-GAAP financial measure, for which further        description and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure may be found        in ACMP\u2019s press release dated July 30, 2013.

The piping, heat exchangers and reboilers in the area just adjacent to          the propylene fractionator have been seriously damaged and will likely          need to be replaced.                         Sections of the electrical cable trays in the elevated portions of a          pipe rack adjacent to the propylene fractionator tower sustained          enough damage such that significant amounts of the electrical power          cable and control wiring in the plant will need to be replaced.                         An approximately 50-foot section of the plant pipe rack containing          portions of the plant steam system, pipeline ethane feed vaporization          systems, and fuel-gas conditioning equipment sustained damage that          will require the replacement of support structures and significant          amounts of piping.                           Other equipment will be evaluated when the company has access to the        incident area.                   While the investigation and plans for repairs are underway, the company        has been and remains focused on employees, contract workers and families        personally affected by the event. At this time, there are no Williams        employees hospitalized; one contract worker remains in the hospital.                   "},

Williams is engaged in development work on the proposed        natural-gas-liquids pipeline, which has a targeted in-service date of        late 2015. The Bluegrass Pipeline will connect supply from the Marcellus        and Utica shale-gas areas in the U.S. Northeast to growing petrochemical        and export markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The pipeline also will        connect NGL supply with the developing petrochemical market in the U.S.        Northeast.                   Williams and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (NYSE:BWP) on May 28        announced they had formalized key joint-venture agreements tied to the        proposed Bluegrass Pipeline and related fractionation, storage and        export projects.                   Phase one of the project will provide producers with 200,000 barrels per        day of mixed NGL take-away capacity in Ohio, West Virginia and        Pennsylvania. Phase two will increase capacity to 400,000 barrels per        day to meet market demand, primarily by adding additional liquids        pumping capacity. The pipeline will deliver mixed NGLs from these        producing areas to new fractionation and storage facilities, providing        connectivity to petrochemical facilities and product pipelines along the        coasts of Louisiana and Texas.                   The Bluegrass Pipeline includes construction of a new NGL pipeline from        producing areas in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania to an        interconnect with Boardwalk's Texas Gas Transmission, LLC system (Texas        Gas) in Hardinsburg, Ky. From that point to Eunice, La., a portion of        Texas Gas would be converted from natural gas service to NGL service.        The joint venture also will include constructing a new large-scale        fractionation plant and expanding natural gas liquids storage facilities        in Louisiana and constructing a new pipeline connecting these facilities        to the converted Texas Gas line in the Eunice, La., area. Williams and        Boardwalk also are exploring development of a new export liquefied        petroleum gas terminal and related facilities on the Gulf Coast to        provide customers access to international markets.                   By combining new construction with an existing pipeline, Williams and        Boardwalk believe that the Bluegrass Pipeline should be placed into        service and begin serving customers sooner than other options. Williams        and Boardwalk are engaged in comprehensive project development planning        including permitting, public consultation and right-of-way acquisition.        Williams and Boardwalk expect that the planned project should be placed        into service in late 2015, assuming all necessary conditions are met.                   Completion of this project is subject to all necessary or required        approvals, elections, and actions, as well as execution of formal        customer commitments.                   "},

The Mid-South Expansion project provides service to power generators in        North Carolina and Alabama as well as a local distribution company in        Georgia. The company placed into service the first phase of the        expansion (95,000 dekatherms per day) in the fall of 2012 and recently        placed into service the second phase of the expansion (130,000        dekatherms per day). Together, both phases of the project deliver enough        natural gas to provide service to approximately one million homes.                   Demand for natural gas in the Southeast is growing at a rate well in        excess of the national average, in large part due to the environmental        advantages of natural gas over other fossil fuels.

Mr. Williams also was a driving force in the redevelopment of downtown        Tulsa. The 52-story BOK Tower and adjacent Williams Center Forum (now        the Williams Resource Center) are direct results of his vision for the        Williams headquarters city.                   He graduated from Ruston Academy in Havana, Cuba and Yale University,        where he majored in civil engineering. After joining the family        business, he worked on projects in North and South America and the        Middle East, in addition to serving in the Navy Civil Engineering Corps        during World War II.                   Mr. Williams has earned many accolades for professional and community        leadership, including an award from the Bolivian government for his        company's work in that country and the Governor's Arts Award for his        role in establishing Tulsa's Performing Arts Center.                   He is survived by his spouse, Joanne S. Williams, and three sons: John        H. Williams, Jr. and his spouse, Carol, of Tulsa; Burch I. Williams and        spouse, Gay, of Tulsa; and S. Miller Williams and spouse, Constance, of        Asheville, N.C.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced unaudited first-quarter        2013 net income of $321 million, or $0.50 per common limited-partner        unit, compared with net income of $408 million, or $0.85 per common        limited-partner unit for first-quarter 2012. Prior-period results        throughout this release have been recast to include the results of the        Geismar olefins production facility acquired from Williams in November        2012.                   The decline in net income during first-quarter 2013 is primarily due to        a sharp decline in NGL margins from near historic highs in first-quarter        2012 and related ethane rejection. NGL margins declined 50 percent from        the first-quarter of 2012 as continued low ethane prices drove system        wide ethane rejection and propane and butane prices also remained at        depressed levels.                   Higher olefin margins, particularly higher ethylene margins at Geismar,        helped mitigate the impact of the lower NGL margins and higher expenses.                    Distributable Cash Flow & Distributions                    For first-quarter 2013, Williams Partners generated $497 million in        distributable cash flow attributable to partnership operations, compared        with $475 million in DCF attributable to partnership operations in        first-quarter 2012.                   The increase in DCF was due to the growth of the partnership via the        acquisition of the Gulf Olefins assets in 2012, as well as higher        gathered volumes, higher fee-based revenues and lower maintenance        capital, partially offset by the previously mentioned decline in NGL        margins.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.8475 per unit, a 9 percent        increase over the year-ago amount.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to report a solid first quarter in the face of NGL        margins that were 50 percent lower than in the prior year. Our growing        fee-based business and our timely acquisition of the Williams\u2019 Geismar        ethylene complex helped to mitigate the less favorable NGL commodity        environment. Our focus continues to be on executing on the wide variety        of growth opportunities across all our businesses that support an        expected increase of more than 60 percent in our DCF from 2013 through        2015.                   \u201cWe expect that ongoing tremendous North American energy infrastructure        needs will continue to combine with Williams Partners\u2019 unique        capabilities to create a continuing robust set of investment        opportunities. As such, we have visibility to very strong growth in our        businesses and cash flows beyond 2015 as our new investments develop and        as we continue to seize many attractive investment opportunities.\u201d                    Business Segment Performance                    Beginning with its first-quarter 2013 results, Williams Partners\u2019        operations are reported through four business segments, Northeast G&P,        Atlantic-Gulf, West and NGL & Petchem Services.

                 Northeast G&P                    Northeast G&P includes the partnership\u2019s midstream gathering and        processing business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, as well        its 51-percent equity investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream (LMM), and        its 47.5-percent equity investment in Caiman Energy II. This segment is        in the early stages of developing large-scale energy infrastructure        solutions for the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.                   Northeast G&P reported a segment loss of $9 million for first-quarter        2013, compared with segment profit of $4 million in first-quarter 2012.                   Continued strong results in the Susquehanna Supply Hub were more than        offset by costs associated with developing business in the Ohio Valley        Midstream system. Higher costs for the Ohio Valley Midstream system were        also affected by various operational issues including system        freeze-offs, line repairs and replacements, as well as expenses        associated with the rapid growth and the high liquids content in this        developing area.                    Atlantic-Gulf                    Atlantic-Gulf includes the Transco interstate gas pipeline, the        partnership\u2019s significant natural gas gathering and processing and crude        production handling and transportation in the Gulf Coast region, as well        as its 50-percent equity investment in the Gulfstream interstate gas        pipeline, its 60-percent equity investment in the Discovery        onshore/offshore natural gas gathering and processing system, and a        51-percent consolidated interest in the Constitution interstate gas        pipeline development project.                   Atlantic-Gulf reported segment profit of $159 million for first-quarter        2013, compared with $165 million for first-quarter 2012.                   The lower segment profit in first-quarter 2013 was due to lower NGL        margins in the Gulf processing facilities as well as lower equity        earnings from the Discovery investment driven by the lower NGL margins.        Lower operating costs partially offset these negative effects during the        first quarter.                    West                    West includes the partnership\u2019s gathering, processing and treating        operations in Wyoming, the Piceance Basin and the Four Corners area, as        well as the Northwest Pipeline interstate gas pipeline system.                   West reported first-quarter 2013 segment profit of $186 million,        compared with $311 million for first-quarter 2012.                   The significant decline in West\u2019s segment profit during first-quarter        2013 was due to lower NGL margins driven by lower NGL prices and higher        gas prices as well as related ethane rejection. Fee-based revenue also        declined during the first quarter due to severe winter weather,        including production freeze-offs. Increased natural gas transportation        revenues associated with Northwest Pipeline\u2019s new rates partially offset        this decline.                    NGL & Petchem Services                    NGL & Petchem Services includes the partnership\u2019s NGL and natural gas        marketing business, an NGL fractionator and storage facilities near        Conway, Kan., a 50-percent equity interest in Overland Pass Pipeline,        and an 83.3% interest and operatorship of an olefins production facility        in Geismar, La., along with a refinery grade propylene splitter and        pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.                   NGL & Petchem Services reported first-quarter 2013 segment profit of        $120 million, compared with $71 million for first-quarter 2012.                   An increase in olefin product margins, primarily ethylene, drove the        increase in segment profit during the first quarter. The higher olefin        margins were driven by lower average per-unit ethane and propane        feedstock prices and higher per-unit ethylene prices.                    Guidance                    Williams Partners is lowering its 2013-14 guidance for earnings and        distributable cash flow primarily to reflect expected lower NGL        processing margins due to higher natural gas price and lower NGL price        assumptions and related lower ethane transportation volumes.        Additionally, the lower segment profit guidance in 2014 includes changes        in in-service date assumptions for certain projects. Partially        offsetting these less favorable assumptions are expectations for        continued strong olefins margins.                   As a result of the expected lower distributable cash flow for 2013 and        2014, Williams Partners is updating guidance for cash distributions per        limited partner unit to reflect an annual growth rate of 8 percent to 9        percent for 2013 and 6 percent to 8 percent for 2014. Williams Partners        is introducing cash distribution growth guidance for 2015   at 6        percent to 8 percent. The partnership\u2019s guidance includes an assumed        growth rate in the limited partner cash distribution of 1.5 cents per        quarter beginning with distributions expected to be declared in July        2013 and paid in August 2013.                   Additionally, Williams has agreed to waive incentive distribution rights        of up to $200 million over the next four quarters to boost Williams        Partners\u2019 expected cash distribution coverage ratio to .90x for 2013.        These IDR waivers provide Williams Partners with short-term cash        distribution support as a large platform of growth projects moves toward        completion. Williams Partners expects a return to stronger coverage        ratios in 2014 and beyond as new projects come into service.

First-Quarter 2013 Materials to be Posted Shortly, Q&A Webcast        Scheduled for Tomorrow                    Williams Partners\u2019 first-quarter 2013 financial results package will be        posted shortly at  www.williamslp.com .        The package will include the data book and analyst package, and the        investor presentation with a recorded commentary from Alan Armstrong,        CEO of Williams Partners\u2019 general partner.                   Williams Partners and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast on        Wednesday, May 8, at 9:30 a.m. EDT. A limited number of phone lines will        be available at (800) 390-5705. International callers should dial (719)        325-2461. A link to the webcast, as well as replays of the webcast in        both streaming and downloadable podcast formats, will be available for        two weeks following the event at  www.williams.com \u00a0and\u00a0 www.williamslp.com .                    Form 10-Q                    The partnership plans to file its first-quarter 2013 Form 10-Q with the        Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document        will be available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.                    Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, adjusted segment profit and        adjusted segment profit + DD&A \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Adjusted segment profit + DD&A is further adjusted to add        back depreciation and amortization expense. Management believes these        measures provide investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners        L.P.'s results from ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A nor distributable cash        flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they        presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

The decline in first-quarter 2013 net income was primarily due to        sharply lower natural gas liquid (NGL) margins and related ethane        rejection at Williams Partners, as well as the absence of $207 million        of income in first-quarter 2012 associated with the sale of certain of        the company\u2019s former Venezuela operations, of which $144 million was        recorded within discontinued operations.                   Higher olefins production margins at Williams Partners partially offset        these negative impacts during the first quarter.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations for first-quarter 2013 was        $152 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with $236 million, or $0.39        per share for first-quarter 2012.                   Lower NGL margins at Williams Partners, including the effects of        system-wide ethane rejection, drove the decline in adjusted income from        continuing operations during first-quarter 2013. Increased costs,        primarily due to higher expenses associated with developing business        that Williams Partners acquired in 2012, also contributed to the        first-quarter decline. These were partially offset by higher olefins        production margins and higher fee-based revenues. There is a more        detailed description of the business results later in this press release.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. A reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached        to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cDespite the headwinds we are facing with low NGL prices and higher        natural gas prices, the growth opportunities in our businesses remain        tremendous and enable us to project dividend growth of 20 percent        annually through 2015. We expect that ongoing tremendous North American        energy infrastructure needs will continue to combine with Williams\u2019        unique capabilities to create a continuing robust set of investment        opportunities. As such, we have visibility to very strong growth in our        businesses and cash flows beyond 2015 as our new investments develop and        as we continue to seize many attractive investment opportunities.                   \u201cOur large capital investment program continues to be focused on growing        our fee-based businesses. The recent run-up in natural gas prices        reduces the margin in the commodity-based portion of our businesses.        Longer term, we think this higher price will drive greater volumes as        producers respond to these more reasonable prices.                   \u201cOur focus continues to be on executing on our wide array of growth        opportunities across our businesses. We announced additional growth        plans in the first quarter, including a potential joint venture with        Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to transport natural gas liquids from the        infrastructure-constrained Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the        rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complex on the U.S. Gulf        Coast. Also in March, we sanctioned construction of a PDH facility in        Alberta, Canada, which will allow Williams to significantly increase        production of polymer-grade propylene from its Canadian operations.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services, Access Midstream Partners,        and Other.

Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; natural gas liquids fractionation;        olefins production; and oil transportation.                   For first-quarter 2013, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $456 million, compared with $551 million for first-quarter 2012.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during first-quarter        2013 is primarily due to a sharp decline in NGL margins from near        historic highs in first-quarter 2012. NGL margins declined 50 percent        from the first-quarter of 2012 as continued low ethane prices drove        system-wide ethane rejection and propane and butane prices also remained        at depressed levels.                   Higher olefin margins, particularly higher ethylene margins at Geismar,        helped mitigate the impact of the lower NGL margins and higher expenses.

Partners\u2019 business        results in the partnership\u2019s first-quarter 2013 financial results news        release, also issued today.                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services primarily includes Williams\u2019 midstream        operations in Canada, including an oil sands offgas processing plant        near Fort McMurray, Alberta and an NGL/olefins fractionation facility        and butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater, Alberta.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment profit of $36 million        for first-quarter 2013, compared with $40 million for first-quarter 2012.                   Segment profit decreased primarily due to increased operating and        maintenance costs, including depreciation related to the Boreal        pipeline, which was placed into service June 2012. Product margins        remained consistent due to offsetting price and volume variances and        fee-based revenues were slightly higher. Lower per-unit NGL product        margins were offset by higher sales volumes; whereas higher per-unit        propylene product margins were offset by lower sales volumes.                    Access Midstream Partners                    The segment results for Access Midstream Partners in the first quarter        2013 included $17 million of equity earnings recognized from Access        Midstream Partners, offset by $17 million non-cash amortization of the        difference between the cost of William\u2019s investment and the company\u2019s        underlying share of the net assets of Access Midstream Partners. Access        Midstream Partners, L.P. reported first-quarter adjusted EBITDA of        $184.4 million, up 55.7 percent from first-quarter 2012. During        first-quarter 2013, Williams received a regular quarterly distribution        of $20 million from Access Midstream Partners.                    Other                    The Other segment benefited from a $53 million gain in 2012 related to        the 2010 sale of the company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela. This        gain has been excluded from the adjusted segment profit for Other.                    Guidance                    Williams is lowering its 2013-14 guidance for earnings and cash flows to        reflect expected lower NGL processing margins due to higher natural gas        price and lower NGL price assumptions and related lower ethane        transportation volumes. Additionally, the lower segment profit guidance        in 2014 includes changes in assumed in-service dates for certain        projects. Partially offsetting these less favorable assumptions are        expectations for continued strong olefins margins.                   In conjunction with the lower guidance announced for Williams Partners,        Williams has agreed to waive incentive distribution rights of up to $200        million over the next four quarters. Williams support is expected to        boost Williams Partners cash coverage to .90x for 2013. The IDR waivers        provide Williams Partners with short-term cash distribution support as a        large platform of growth projects moves toward completion. Williams        Partners expects cash coverage of .97x in 2014 and 1.03x in 2015 without        the benefit of IDR waivers.                   For 2013 through 2015, Williams expects strong cash flow growth from        Williams Partners, Williams NGL & Petchem Services and Access Midstream        Partners to drive 20 percent annual cash dividend growth.                   Capital expenditures included in guidance have been adjusted to reflect        recently announced projects including the Canada PDH project and the        Three Rivers Midstream joint venture with Shell, as well as a number of        additional projects and revisions.                   The proposed Bluegrass Pipeline project development costs, capital,        earnings and cash flow are not currently reflected in guidance as the        project has not been sanctioned at this time.

Form 10-Q                    The company plans to file its first-quarter 2013 Form 10-Q with the        Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Once filed, the document        will be available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted segment profit + DD&A, adjusted income from        continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013        that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations. Management believes these measures provide investors        meaningful insight into the company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        segment profit + DD&A, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per        share measures are intended to represent an alternative to segment        profit, net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.                   This press release also includes cash distribution coverage ratios for        Williams Partners and adjusted EBITDA for Access Midstream Partners, LP        that are non-GAAP financial measures, for which further description and        reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures may be found in Williams        Partners\u2019 press release dated May 7, 2013, and ACMP\u2019s press release        dated April 30, 2013, respectively.

Phase two would increase capacity to 400,000 barrels        per day to meet market demand, primarily by adding additional liquids        pumping capacity. The pipeline would deliver mixed NGLs from these        producing areas to proposed new fractionation and storage facilities,        which would have connectivity to petrochemical facilities and product        pipelines along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.                   The proposed Bluegrass Pipeline would include constructing a new NGL        pipeline from producing areas in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania to        an interconnect with Boardwalk\u2019s Texas Gas Transmission, LLC system        (Texas Gas) in Hardinsburg, Ky. From that point to Eunice, La., a        portion of Texas Gas would be converted from natural gas service to NGL        service.                   The joint venture would also include constructing a new large-scale        fractionation plant and expanding natural gas liquids storage facilities        in Louisiana and constructing a new pipeline connecting these facilities        to the converted Texas Gas line in the Eunice, La. area. Williams and        Boardwalk are also exploring development of a new export liquefied        petroleum gas terminal and related facilities on the Gulf Coast to        provide customers access to international markets.                   By combining new construction with an existing pipeline, Williams and        Boardwalk believe that the Bluegrass Pipeline could be placed into        service and begin serving customers sooner than other options. Williams        and Boardwalk are engaged in comprehensive project development planning        including project design, cost estimating, economic and risk analysis,        customer contracting, permitting and other legal and regulatory        approvals and right-of-way acquisition. Williams and Boardwalk expect        that the planned project could be placed into service in late 2015        assuming all necessary conditions are met.                   \u201cThis timely joint venture with Boardwalk would link two liquids-rich        resource plays in the Northeast U.S. with the expanding petrochemical        industry on the Gulf Coast, providing producers in Ohio, West Virginia        and Pennsylvania with the ability to access large and growing markets,\u201d        said Alan Armstrong,\u00a0president and\u00a0chief executive officer of Williams.        \u201cThe large scale solution has many advantages including an early in        service date, lower environmental impact, lower cost and lower        permitting risk.\u201d                   \u201cWe are pleased to have formalized this joint venture with Williams to        develop an industry solution of connecting prolific Marcellus and Utica        liquids production to the markets where these products are in high        demand,\u201d said Stan Horton, president and chief executive officer of        Boardwalk. \u201cThe Bluegrass Pipeline project provides an opportunity to        leverage our liquids assets in the Lake Charles, La. area and repurpose        a portion of Texas Gas without impacting our firm service to existing        natural gas customers.\u201d                   Sanctioning and completion of this project is subject to, among other        conditions, execution of customer contracts sufficient to support the        project and the parties' receipt of all necessary approvals, including        Williams and Boardwalk board approvals and regulatory approvals, such as        antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements        Act, and approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),        among others. Before the joint venture may begin converting the portion        of Texas Gas to be converted, Texas Gas must receive abandonment        authority from FERC. Boardwalk plans to file the abandonment application        with FERC by May 31, 2013, and the abandonment process is estimated to        take between nine and twelve months.                    About Boardwalk (NYSE: BWP)                    Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (NYSE: BWP) is a midstream master        limited partnership that provides transportation, storage, gathering and        processing of natural gas and liquids for its customers.

By combining new construction with an existing pipeline, Williams and        Boardwalk believe that the Bluegrass Pipeline can be placed into service        and begin serving customers sooner than other options. Williams and        Boardwalk are engaged in comprehensive project development planning        including project design, cost estimating, economic and risk analysis,        customer contracting, permitting and other legal and regulatory        approvals and right-of-way acquisition. Williams and Boardwalk expect to        sanction the project this year and place the planned project into        service in the second half of 2015 assuming all necessary conditions are        met.                   \u201cWe are designing Bluegrass Pipeline\u00a0to provide these two world-class        resource plays with access to one of the largest and most dynamic        petrochemical markets in the world. In turn, this will help\u00a0producers in        Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia achieve an attractive value        for\u00a0their ethane and other liquids,\u201d\u00a0said Alan Armstrong,\u00a0president        and\u00a0chief executive officer of Williams. \u201cThe current infrastructure        challenge with natural gas liquids in the Northeast is slowing        drilling\u00a0and isolating liquids supplies from the robust markets in the        Gulf that are poised to grow substantially over the next five years.\u201d                   \u201cGiven current market dynamics in the Northeast, existing liquids        systems and local outlets will be overwhelmed by 2016. Total NGL volumes        in the Northeast are expected to exceed 1.2 million barrels per day by        2020. The proposed Bluegrass Pipeline joint venture would support        Williams\u2019 midstream assets in the region, offer an attractive return and        enable Williams to become the premier NGL infrastructure provider by        economically linking the Utica and Marcellus region to petrochemical        complexes on the U.S. Gulf,\u201d Armstrong said.                   \u201cWe are delighted to be working with Williams on this exciting project,\u201d        said Stan Horton, president and CEO of Boardwalk. \u201cWe believe that the        unique arrangement of this planned project would create several        strategic advantages, including a faster in-service date complemented by        a significantly reduced construction footprint than could be achieved        with a completely organic project.\u201d                   \u201cOur pursuit of this project is also consistent with Boardwalk\u2019s        long-term growth strategy of diversifying within the midstream energy        sector and leveraging our newly-acquired liquids infrastructure assets        at Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, which provide a critical footprint for        the downstream fractionation and storage portion of this project.        Another key element is that Texas Gas would connect its natural gas        customers along the length of the converted TGT Loop Line to the        remaining Texas Gas lines and will continue to provide them, and all of        Texas Gas\u2019 natural gas customers, with safe and reliable natural gas        transportation service,\u201d said Horton.                   Sanctioning and completion of this project is subject to, among other        conditions, negotiation and execution of definitive joint venture and        related agreements; execution of customer contracts sufficient to        support the project; and the parties\u2019 receipt of all necessary        approvals, including board approvals and regulatory approvals, such as        antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements        Act, approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among        others. Before Texas Gas Transmission may begin converting the TGT Loop        Line, it must receive abandonment authority from FERC. Boardwalk plans        to file the abandonment application with FERC by May 1, 2013 and the        abandonment process is estimated to take between nine to twelve months.

The new PDH        facility, the first and only in Canada, will allow Williams to        significantly increase production of polymer-grade propylene from its        Canadian operations. Williams is the only company in Canada currently        producing polymer-grade propylene, a valuable petrochemical feedstock        used in plastics manufacturing.                   Williams\u2019 PDH facility in Canada will have the capability to initially        produce up to approximately 1.1 billion pounds (500 kilotonnes) annually        of polymer-grade propylene, with the opportunity to double capacity with        a future expansion. The company estimates capital expenditures of up to        $900 million CAD to be funded with expected cash flow from its Canadian        operation and international cash on hand. Pending appropriate permitting        approvals, the PDH facility is scheduled to go into service in the        second quarter of 2016.                   Williams has selected Honeywell\u2019s UOP as the vendor to provide the UOP        Oleflex\u2122 process technology for the dehydrogenation process. The        technology is environmentally superior because it uses a platinum-based        catalyst system, as well as less energy and water than competing PDH        technologies. Williams' PDH facility will be sited in close proximity to        its existing Redwater fractionation plant near Edmonton, Alberta.                   Williams plans to primarily use propane recovered from its expanding oil        sands offgas processing operations along with local propane purchases as        feedstock for the new PDH facility. It will convert the propane into        higher-value propylene that will be transported to the U.S. Gulf Coast        and sold to petrochemical producers. Plans are to sell the associated        hydrogen byproduct in the Alberta market. Williams is also exploring        development of new propylene markets for its production in Alberta.                   The Redwater complex includes fractionation, storage and distribution        facilities and is currently being expanded to produce approximately 5        million barrels of propane and 280 million pounds of polymer-grade        propylene annually from offgas, in addition to other NGLs and olefins.        The addition of the new PDH facility will vastly increase Williams\u2019        production of polymer-grade propylene. The company expects the new        facility to produce one of the lowest-cost, PDH-sourced propylene        feedstocks in North America.                   \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be moving full-speed ahead on Canada\u2019s first and only        PDH facility. The project fits strategically within Williams\u2019 operations        in Alberta, leverages our expertise in propylene and adds further value        to a byproduct of oil sands upgraders,\u201d said David Chappell, president        of Williams Energy Canada. \u201cOnce operational, this new propane        dehydrogenation facility will expand market opportunities for Canada,        feed the demands of North America\u2019s growing petrochemical industry and        allow for the creation of a new value chain in Alberta.\u201d                   \u201cWe are extremely excited about this project on many levels,\u201d said Alan        Armstrong, president and chief executive officer of Williams. \u201cWe expect        the PDH facility to deliver a very attractive return on investment as        well as provide a long-term natural hedge of the propane volumes we        control in our Canadian offgas processing business. Our planned PDH        facility will enable Williams to capture the full value between natural        gas and polymer-grade propylene rather than just the value between        natural gas and propane.\u201d                    Williams\u2019 Operations in Canada: Innovative Business, Emissions Reducer                    When producers convert the Canadian oil sands into usable oil, the        process produces an offgas byproduct that includes a rich mixture of        natural gas, NGLs and olefins. Williams  pioneered        the process  of extracting the mixture from the offgas at its Fort        McMurray, Alberta, liquids extraction plant.                   After it extracts the offgas mixture, Williams returns the clean-burning        natural gas to the third-party oil sands producer for its operations. It        then transports the remaining NGL/olefins mixture, via Williams\u2019 Boreal        Pipeline, to its Redwater fractionation facility for further separation.                   Williams\u2019 offgas processing reduces emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2013        a greenhouse gas \u2013 in Alberta by approximately 200,000 tonnes each year        and cuts emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) \u2013 a contributor to acid rain        \u2013 by an average of 1,700 tonnes each year. The new offgas expansions        will further reduce both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions in        Alberta.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) announced today that its Transco pipeline        has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission        (FERC) to provide another natural gas delivery point from its Transco        pipeline to New York City.                   The Rockaway Delivery Lateral Project is designed to provide        approximately 647,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas delivery        capacity to National Grid\u2019s gas distribution system in Brooklyn and        Queens, New York, providing National Grid with both supply flexibility        and increased capacity to meet future incremental demand growth. The        project is proposed to be placed into service during the second half of        2014.                   \u201cThe project would create an additional delivery point from the existing        Transco system into National Grid\u2019s distribution network, enhancing        service reliability and serving growth in the region,\u201d said Frank        Ferazzi, vice president and general manager of Williams Partners\u2019        Transco pipeline. \u201cThis project is critical to provide the additional        natural gas supplies New York City needs, particularly as it strives to        meet federal environmental standards and its own ambitious clean energy        goals identified in its PlaNYC 2030.\u201d                   The proposed 3.2-mile 26-inch lateral would consist of approximately 2.9        miles of offshore pipeline and approximately 0.3 miles of onshore        pipeline. The preferred route avoids residential, commercial and        sensitive environmental areas. The sea to shore portion of the pipeline        (approximately one mile) would be constructed using subsurface        directional drilling technology, allowing Williams to avoid all impacts        to the beach and near-shore areas, as well as onshore portions of Jacob        Riis Park.                   If approved by FERC, construction could begin in late 2013. The capital        cost of the project is estimated to be $182 million.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,200-mile pipeline system which transports        natural gas to markets throughout the northeastern and southeastern        United States. The current system capacity is approximately 9.7 million        dekatherms per day.                   "},

The Transco pipeline delivered a record-breaking 10.4 million dekatherms        on Jan. 22. The new peak-day mark surpasses the previous high of 9.7        million dekatherms set early last year.                   Transco also set a three-day delivery record Jan. 22-24, averaging 9.9        million dekatherms per day.                   The Jan. 22 record volume represents enough gas to heat more than 45        million U.S. homes. The 10.4 dekatherms is approximately 106 percent of        firm contract demand on the Transco pipeline. Transco\u2019s storage services        were instrumental in meeting demand and maintaining prescribed operating        pressure.                   Rory Miller, senior vice president of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic - Gulf        operating area, said preparation, experience, reliable operations and        recent expansions were all keys in setting a peak-day delivery record on        Transco.                   \u201cThe recent cold wave in the Northeast is another reminder of the        importance of adequate infrastructure in meeting our country\u2019s energy        demand,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWith growing demand for natural gas to serve        winter heating loads and cleaner burning power generation, it is vital        that we continue to develop pipeline and other infrastructure to        reliably meet these needs.\u201d                   In order to help deliver vital energy infrastructure, Williams Partners        has  plans        to expand  Transco\u2019s daily capacity by nearly 2 million dekatherms by        2015. This amount of new capacity is roughly equal the amount of new        daily capacity that Transco has placed into service over the past five        years.                   The Transco pipeline is a 10,000-mile pipeline system that extends from        south Texas to New York. The system serves major markets along the U.S.        Eastern Seaboard.                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced unaudited 2012 net income        of $1.23 billion, or $1.89 per common limited-partner unit, compared        with 2011 net income of $1.51 billion, or $3.69 per common        limited-partner unit.                   For fourth-quarter 2012, Williams Partners reported net income of $291        million, or $0.42 per common limited-partner unit, compared with $412        million, or $1.05 per common limited-partner unit, for fourth-quarter        2011.                   The decline in net income during the 2012 periods is due to a        significant decline in natural gas liquid (NGL) margins, primarily        driven by a sharp mid-year decline in NGL prices during 2012, which led        to lower results in the partnership\u2019s midstream business. Higher        expenses associated with developing businesses acquired during 2012,        also contributed to the lower results for the year.                   An increase in fee-based revenue partially offset the negative impacts        of lower NGL prices and other factors. Fee-based revenue in Williams        Partners\u2019 midstream business increased by more than 18 percent in        fourth-quarter 2012 compared with fourth-quarter 2011. For the full        year, fee-based revenue in the partnership\u2019s midstream business was up        17 percent over 2011.                   There is a more detailed analysis of the partnership\u2019s businesses later        in this news release. Prior-period results throughout this release have        been recast to include the results of the olefins production facility        acquired from Williams in November 2012.                    Distributable Cash Flow                    For 2012, Williams Partners generated $1.49 billion in distributable        cash flow attributable to partnership operations, compared with $1.65        billion in DCF attributable to partnership operations in 2011.                   For the fourth quarter of 2012, Williams Partners generated $405 million        in DCF attributable to partnership operations, compared with $444        million for the fourth quarter of 2011.                   The previously noted significant decline in NGL margins was the key        driver of the decline in distributable cash flow. Higher fee-based        revenue in the midstream business partially offset the lower NGL        margins. Although fourth-quarter 2012 distributable cash flow declined        compared with fourth-quarter 2011, it increased 28 percent sequentially        compared with the third-quarter 2012 amount of $316 million.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.8275 per unit, an 8.5 percent        increase over the year-ago amount. As planned, the partnership\u2019s        previously strong cash distribution coverage enabled it to continue its        cash distribution growth during a period of significantly unfavorable        commodity prices. Also, the partnership has issued a significant amount        of additional partnership units this year to finance numerous projects        that are in the early stages of development.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cOur 2012 results were impacted by the significant decline in NGL        margins during the year, but our fee-based business growth, including 18        percent growth in Midstream during the fourth quarter, helped mitigate        our commodity exposure.                   \u201cWe continue to rapidly grow our fee-based business. We are directing        the vast majority of the $12 billion of our 2012-2014 growth capital to        projects that serve to reduce the effect of NGL prices on our earnings.        As well, our newly acquired and significantly expanding olefins business        also has the effect of reducing our exposure to ethane prices.                   \u201cWe expect to return our cash-distribution coverage to normal levels in        2014 as we bring into service this vast array of fee-based projects and        benefit from the significant expansion of our olefins business.                   \u201cThe need for reliable energy infrastructure is growing rapidly, as        demand continues to grow for low-cost natural gas to serve winter        heating loads and cleaner burning power generation, as well as the        booming petrochemical and manufacturing sectors. We\u2019re well positioned        to help meet these demands; our focus now is executing on the wide        variety of growth opportunities across our businesses,\u201d Armstrong said.                    2013-14 Guidance                    Williams Partners is lowering its 2013-14 guidance for adjusted segment        profit and distributable cash flow primarily to reflect sharply lower        commodity margin assumptions.                   Capital expenditures for 2013-14 are increasing, primarily due to        increases of approximately $220 million in 2013 and $210 million in 2014        associated with a change in the forecasting presentation for Williams        Partners\u2019 Gulfstar FPS and Constitution Pipeline projects. Previous        capital expenditure guidance only reflected Williams Partners\u2019        51-percent interest in Gulfstar and its 51-percent interest in        Constitution. While Williams Partners\u2019 interests in each project are        unchanged, the new guidance reflects Gulfstar and Constitution on a        fully consolidated basis with our partners non-controlling interests        reflected separately. The capital increases associated with this        presentation change will be fully offset by capital contributions from        the partners on each project.                   Earlier this month, Williams Partners announced that Marubeni        Corporation agreed to acquire a 49-percent interest in the Gulfstar        project. Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) and Piedmont Natural Gas (NYSE: PNY)        own 25-percent and 24-percent interests in Constitution, respectively.

Northwest Pipeline \u2013 and owns 50 percent of Gulfstream.        These systems have a combined peak day delivery capacity of more than 14        billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and transport approximately 14        percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.                   Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $677 million for 2012, compared        with $673 million for 2011. The increase in segment profit for the year        was due to increased revenue from expansion projects placed into        service, as well as higher equity earnings from Gulfstream due primarily        to the partnership\u2019s increased ownership percentage and a decrease in        expenses related to the Eminence storage leak. These factors were mostly        offset by higher costs and operating expenses.                   For fourth-quarter 2012, Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $195        million, compared with $176 million for the same time period in 2011.        The reversal of project feasibility costs of three expansion projects        from expense to capital, as well as higher revenue from expansion        projects, drove the fourth-quarter 2012 increase in segment profit.        Higher costs and expenses partially offset these benefits in the fourth        quarter.                    Midstream Gas & Liquids                    Midstream provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing;        deepwater production handling and oil transportation; and NGL        fractionation, storage and transportation services; and olefin        production.                   The business reported segment profit of $1.14 billion for 2012, compared        with segment profit of $1.36 billion for 2011. For fourth-quarter 2012,        Midstream reported segment profit of $246 million, compared with $364        million for fourth-quarter 2011.                   Significantly lower NGL prices, partially offset by lower natural gas        prices, was the primary driver of the lower segment profit in the        full-year and fourth-quarter 2012 results. Higher operating costs and        selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, both partially        attributable to developing businesses acquired during the year, also        contributed to the lower segment profit. Included in the full-year 2012        results are $25 million of acquisition and transition costs and $61        million of depreciation expense related to the Caiman (now part of Ohio        Valley Midstream area) and Laser (now part of Susquehanna Supply Hub        area) acquisitions of early 2012.                   Higher fee-based revenues partially offset the negative impacts        described above. The increase in fee-based revenues was primarily due to        higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale area, including new volumes on the        Ohio Valley Midstream system and Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering        assets. Higher olefin margins, driven primarily by lower ethylene        feedstock prices also partially offset the negative impacts.                    Year-End Materials to be Posted Shortly, Q&A Webcast Scheduled for        Tomorrow                    Williams Partners\u2019 year-end 2012 financial results package will be        posted shortly at  www.williamslp.com .        The package will include the data book and analyst package, and the        investor presentation with a recorded commentary from Alan Armstrong,        CEO of Williams Partners\u2019 general partner.                   Williams Partners L.P. and Williams will host a joint Q&A live webcast        on Thursday, Feb. 21 at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines        will be available at (888) 401-4690. International callers should dial        (719) 325-2461. A link to the live year-end webcast, as well as replays        of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats will        be available for two weeks following the event at  www.williamslp.com         and  www.williams.com .                    Form 10-K                    The partnership plans to file its 2012 Form 10-K with the Securities and        Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be        available on both the SEC and Williams Partners websites.                    Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, and adjusted segment profit        \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes adjusted segment profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent        cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to        net income or cash flow from operations.

The increase in net income for 2012 was primarily due to the absence of        a $427 million loss from discontinued operations in 2011. The        significant loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was primarily due        to significant non-cash property impairment and other charges associated        with Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business. The 2012 net        income also benefited from $136 million of income from discontinued        operations, primarily due to gains following the sale of certain of our        former Venezuela operations.                   For fourth-quarter 2012, Williams reported net income of $149 million,        or $0.23 per share on a diluted basis, compared with a net loss of $444        million, or a loss of $0.74 per share, for fourth-quarter 2011.                   The substantial increase in net income during the fourth quarter of 2012        is due to the absence of the previously described non-cash property        impairment and other charges associated with Williams\u2019 former        exploration and production business recorded in fourth-quarter 2011.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $695 million, or $1.11        per share, for 2012, compared with $734 million, or $1.23 per share for        2011. For fourth-quarter 2012, adjusted income from continuing        operations was $160 million, or $0.25 per share, compared with $214        million, or $0.36 per share for fourth quarter 2011.                   Lower NGL margins at Williams Partners and increased costs, partially        offset by higher fee-based revenue and increased olefin margins, drove        the decline in adjusted income from continuing operations during the        2012 periods. There is a more detailed description of the business        results later in this press release.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. Reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached to        this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cThis past year was one of significant growth and change at Williams. We        spun off WPX Energy at the end of 2011 and followed that up by seizing        on a significant number of strategic growth opportunities. Our focus now        is executing on our portfolio of great growth projects across of our        operating areas \u2013 from the Marcellus and Utica Shale and Canada to the        deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                   \u201cWe\u2019ve reaffirmed our annual dividend growth guidance of 20 percent in        each of 2013 and 2014 in the face of sharply lower ethane and propane        prices. We\u2019re basing our strong dividend growth outlook on the continued        rapid growth of our fee-based business and the strong mitigating effect        of the Geismar ethylene complex. We also continue to expect strong        growth in 2014 and beyond as we place into service the large-scale        projects that are currently under construction. As well, recent        investments, including Access Midstream and Caiman II, serve to sustain        our long-term growth.                   \u201cThere continues to be significant demand for energy infrastructure to        connect North America\u2019s prolific shale plays to growing markets, from        power generation to petrochemical manufacturing. Williams is        well-positioned to provide the kind of large-scale infrastructure        solutions that are needed to meet demand,\u201d Armstrong said.                    2013-14 Guidance                    Williams is lowering its 2013-14 earnings guidance primarily to reflect        sharply lower commodity margin assumptions.                   Capital expenditures for 2013-14 are increasing, primarily due to        increases of approximately $220 million in 2013 and $210 million in 2014        associated with a change in the forecasting presentation for Williams        Partners\u2019 Gulfstar FPS and Constitution Pipeline projects. Previous        capital expenditure guidance only reflected Williams Partners\u2019        51-percent interest in Gulfstar and its 51-percent interest in        Constitution. While Williams Partners\u2019 interests in each project are        unchanged, the new guidance reflects Gulfstar and Constitution on a        fully consolidated basis with our partners non-controlling interests        reflected separately. The capital increases associated with this        presentation change will be fully offset by capital contributions from        the partners on each project.                   Earlier this month, Williams Partners announced that Marubeni        Corporation agreed to acquire a 49-percent interest in the Gulfstar        project. Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) and Piedmont Natural Gas (NYSE: PNY)        own 25-percent and 24-percent interests in Constitution, respectively.                   Williams expects cash tax rates for 2013-14 to be sharply lower than        previous guidance due to legislation that extended bonus depreciation        and the company\u2019s investment in ACMP.

Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; natural gas liquid (NGL)        fractionation; and oil transportation.                   For 2012, Williams Partners reported segment profit of $1.81 billion,        compared with $2.04 billion for 2011. For fourth quarter 2012, Williams        Partners reported segment profit of $441 million, compared with $540        million for fourth quarter 2011.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during 2012 periods is        due to a significant decline in NGL margins, which led to lower results        in the partnership\u2019s midstream business. A substantial decline in NGL        prices was the key driver of the lower NGL margins in 2012. Higher        expenses associated with developing businesses acquired earlier in the        year also contributed to the lower results in 2012.                   An increase in fee-based revenue, including a fourth-quarter 2012        increase of 18 percent in the partnership\u2019s midstream business,        partially offset the impacts of lower NGL prices and other factors.        Higher olefin margins from the recently acquired Gulf Olefin assets also        helped mitigate the impact of the lower NGL margins and higher expenses.

Valley Midstream system and        Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering assets.                   There is a more detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 interstate        gas pipeline and midstream business results in the partnership\u2019s        year-end 2012 financial results news release, which is also being issued        today.                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services                    Williams NGL & Petchem Services primarily includes Williams\u2019 midstream        operations in Canada including an oil sands offgas processing plant near        Fort McMurray, Alberta and an NGL/olefin fractionation facility and        butylene/butane splitter facility at Redwater, Alberta.                   Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment profit of $99 million        for 2012, compared with $157 million for 2011. For the fourth quarter of        2012, Williams NGL & Petchem Services reported segment profit of $27        million, compared with $54 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.                   The decline in segment profit during the 2012 periods was due to lower        Canadian NGL and propylene product margins driven by lower per-unit        sales prices. These factors were partially offset by higher propylene        sales volumes.                    Other                    The Other segment benefited from gains related to the 2010 sale of the        company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela of $53 million in 2012 and        $11 million in 2011.

Williams and Williams Partners L.P. will host a joint Q&A live webcast        on Thursday, Feb. 21 at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines        will be available at (888) 401-4690. International callers should dial        (719) 325-2461. A link to the live year-end webcast, as well as replays        of the webcast in both streaming and downloadable podcast formats will        be available for two weeks following the event at\u00a0 www.williams.com \u00a0and\u00a0 www.williamslp.com .                    Form 10-K                    The company plans to file its 2012 Form 10-K with the Securities and        Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be        available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d)        and adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures        as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.        Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per        share measures exclude items of income or loss that the company        characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations. Management        believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into the        company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance.

(NYSE:ACMP) today announced it has        agreed to acquire Chesapeake Midstream Operating, L.L.C., a wholly owned        subsidiary of Chesapeake Midstream Development, L.L.C., from Chesapeake        Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) for $2.16 billion in cash. The acquisition        adds natural gas gathering and processing assets in the Eagle Ford,        Utica and Niobrara liquids-rich plays and expands Access\u2019 existing        position in both the Haynesville and Marcellus dry gas plays.        Separately, Access and Chesapeake have agreed to extend Access\u2019        exclusivity period with respect to Chesapeake\u2019s remaining assets in the        Mid-Continent region until March 1, 2013.                   The acquisition of the midstream assets is a transformational        opportunity for Access and will create the leading gathering and        processing MLP in the country. Upon completion of this transaction,        Access will have large scale, well established footprints in virtually        all of the major unconventional basins in the United States. The        acquisition provides immediate entry to gathering opportunities in key        liquids-rich regions and to the processing and fractionation segments of        the midstream value chain. Consistent with the Partnership\u2019s current        portfolio of assets, the acquired assets are anchored by long-term,        market-based, cost of service agreements with Chesapeake and other        producer customers. This long-term, cost of service contract structure        provides protections for capital, inflation and re-contracting risks        resulting in highly visible and predictable cash flows. The acquisition        is expected to close by the end of 2012 and be immediately accretive to        distributable cash flow.                   Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, Williams (NYSE:WMB) will        acquire 50 percent of the general partner of Access and 34.5 million of        Access\u2019 subordinated limited partner units from Global Infrastructure        Partners. Williams\u2019 vast midstream experience will complement GIP\u2019s        strong strategic and financial sponsorship as Access continues to        execute on its best in class business model.                   GIP and Williams have entered into a subscription agreement to purchase        an aggregate of up to $1.16 billion of additional limited partner        interests, including $350 million of paid in kind equity, demonstrating        their substantial commitment to Access\u2019 long-term success. Access has        concurrently obtained debt commitments to finance the balance of the        purchase price. Citigroup, Barclays and UBS Investment Bank have        provided commitments for a $1.0 billion acquisition bridge facility.        Barclays and Citi acted as exclusive financial advisors to Access with        respect to the acquisition and its related financings.                   Terms of the CMO acquisition were unanimously approved by the Board of        Directors of Access\u2019 general partner and by the Board\u2019s Conflicts        Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors. The        Conflicts Committee engaged Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities,        Inc. to act as its financial advisor and Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A.        to act as its legal advisor and also received advice from Jones Day        which acted as counsel to Access.                    Management Comments                    J. Mike Stice, Access Midstream Partners\u2019 Chief Executive Officer,        commented, \u201cThe acquisition of these midstream assets is a        transformational opportunity for Access. Following this transaction,        Access will become the largest gathering and processing MLP as measured        by invested capital and throughput volume and will have a substantially        diversified portfolio with a critical midstream position in the most        prominent liquids-rich basins in the United States. The extension of our        services into gas processing, fractionation and NGL pipelines will        enhance our ability to grow and deliver additional value to our        unitholders going forward.                   \u201cI know the Williams team well and am very excited to add their        world-class sponsorship to Access. Our ability to leverage Williams\u2019        deep midstream operational and development capabilities will        significantly benefit our expanded operations and lead to new growth        opportunities for years to come. With GIP\u2019s continued position, we now        have two great sponsors with a substantial commitment to Access and a        strong belief in our assets and business model.\u201d                    Conference Call Information                    A conference call to discuss the acquisition has been scheduled for        Tuesday, December 11, 2012 at 5:45 p.m. EST.

ACMP announced plans today to acquire most        of Chesapeake Energy Corp.\u2019s (NYSE:CHK) remaining natural gas and        crude-oil gathering assets for $2.16 billion.                   After closing, Williams and GIP each will own a 50 percent interest in        Access GP, which holds a 2 percent general partner interest and        incentive distribution rights. Williams and GIP have committed to invest        up to $1.16 billion in newly issued ACMP limited partner units and will        own approximately 25 percent and 43 percent, respectively, of the        outstanding ACMP LP units at the time of the transaction closing        (depending on certain capital-raising activities of ACMP).                   This investment \u2013 together with ACMP\u2019s planned acquisition of        Chesapeake's remaining natural gas and crude-oil gathering assets \u2013        significantly expands Williams\u2019 economic opportunities in 10 major shale        and unconventional producing areas, including the Marcellus, Utica,        Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Barnett, Permian, Granite Wash, Colony Wash,        Mississippi Lime and Niobrara.                   ACMP is an Oklahoma City-based, growth-oriented midstream natural gas        services provider that, following its acquisition of Chesapeake\u2019s        remaining gathering business, will have an average throughput of        approximately 3.9 billion cubic feet per day and more than 5,800 miles        of gathering pipelines and 8.7 million acres under long-term dedication.                    Transaction Detail                    Williams has agreed to acquire GIP\u2019s Fund I holdings in ACMP. Those        holdings include GIP Fund I\u2019s 50 percent interest in Access GP, which        owns the 2 percent general partner interest and incentive distribution        rights in ACMP, and approximately 34.5 million ACMP subordinated limited        partner units for $1.823 billion.                   Additionally, Williams and GIP\u2019s Fund II each committed to acquire        between approximately $350 million and $580 million (depending on        certain capital-raising activities of ACMP) of Class B payment-in-kind        (PIK) units, Class C subordinated units and potentially common units        directly from ACMP to support ACMP\u2019s acquisition of the Chesapeake        assets. The Class B and C units are convertible at the option of the        holder or ACMP into common units on the day after the record date for        the distribution to common units for the fiscal quarters ending Dec. 31,        2014, and Dec. 31, 2013, respectively.                   GIP is an independent private-equity fund with more than $15 billion        under management. The New York-based fund invests globally in        infrastructure assets. Its investment in ACMP began in 2009.                   Upon closing of these transactions, ACMP will continue to be an        independent, publicly traded master limited partnership. ACMP will        continue as the operator of the assets and maintain its headquarters in        Oklahoma City. ACMP will benefit from the continuity of ACMP\u2019s existing,        experienced leadership team and employees, including those associated        with the assets ACMP is acquiring from Chesapeake.                   Following this transaction, Williams and GIP, each 50 percent owners of        Access GP, will have equal governance rights; ACMP will be governed by        its board of directors in accordance with its governance documents.        Williams will have the right, upon closing of the transactions announced        today, to appoint certain of its representatives as directors to Access        GP\u2019s board of directors.                   Post-closing, Williams and GIP will own 25 percent and 43 percent,        respectively, of ACMP LP units (depending on certain capital-raising        activities of ACMP). Williams and GIP Fund II will maintain a        right-of-first-offer on the sale of each other\u2019s interests.                   Separately, ACMP and Chesapeake are engaged through March 1, 2013, in        exclusive negotiations toward a purchase and sale agreement for        Chesapeake's remaining Mid-Continent gathering-and-processing business.                    CEO Perspective                    \u201cWe believe Williams\u2019 investment in Access GP and ACMP is both strategic        and value-creating,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, Williams\u2019 chief executive        officer. \u201cACMP is an established, growing master limited partnership        with a strong presence in new, attractive basins that significantly        diversifies Williams\u2019 portfolio and over the long term will support our        strategy and our ability to provide attractive dividend growth.                   \u201cWe expect Williams investors will enjoy significant value from the        rapidly growing cash distributions that Williams will receive from ACMP        \u2013 both on limited partner and general partner interests with its        incentive distribution rights. The characteristics of our investment in        ACMP are consistent with our strategy to focus our business on        large-scale, market-leading positions and increasing fee-based        revenues,\u201d Armstrong said.                   \u201cThis transaction provides for a strategic investment by Williams in        ACMP \u2013 two Oklahoma-based companies focused on providing safe, reliable        infrastructure services to the natural gas industry \u2013 with an        attractive, very strong financial sponsor, GIP,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe        have great confidence in ACMP\u2019s proven management team and our        comprehensive due diligence efforts on this transaction substantiate the        depth and quality of talent throughout ACMP,\u201d he said.                   \u201cWith ACMP\u2019s planned acquisition of most of Chesapeake\u2019s remaining        midstream business, our investment also provides us with an interest in        assets in some of the best acreage positions in prolific and        economically durable shale plays,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAs well,        Oklahoma-based Chesapeake leads ACMP\u2019s diverse customer base of U.S. and        international integrated majors and large independent producers.\u201d                    Support for Northeast-to-Gulf-Coast NGL Pipeline Project in Initial        Development                    Separately, Chesapeake has affirmed its intention to support Williams\u2019        development of a proposed NGL pipeline that would connect liquids-rich        Marcellus and Utica producing areas in the Northeast to large, diverse        markets in the Gulf Coast. Williams is developing this project as a        large-scale industry solution to support the long-term success of        producers in these important shale-producing areas of the Northeast        United States.                   \u201cWilliams is excited to have the opportunity to work with Chesapeake to        help optimize and monetize its tremendous acreage position,\u201d Armstrong        said.                    Transaction Funding, Closing & Financial Guidance                    Williams plans to fund the purchase price of its interests in Access GP        and ACMP with a combination of equity and debt. In addition, Williams        has entered into a backup financing commitment with respect to a $2.5        billion bridge facility with UBS Investment Bank, Barclays and Citigroup        that would be available to fund the full cash purchase price for the        acquisition.                   The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. Williams        expects its acquisition of the Access GP interest and ACMP limited        partner units to close prior to the end of this year. As well, Williams        and GIP expect ACMP\u2019s acquisition of certain midstream assets from        Chesapeake to close prior to the end of the year.                   Williams today reaffirmed its guidance for 20 percent annual growth in        the dividend it pays shareholders: $1.44 per share in 2013 and $1.75 per        share in 2014. The company\u2019s 2012 dividend is $1.20 per share (a 55        percent increase over 2011). Williams expects rapidly growing        distributions from its ACMP limited partner and Access GP interests,        including incentive distribution rights, to add to drivers of continued        strong dividend growth in 2014 and beyond.                   For earnings and cash flow per share, Williams expects the transaction        will be slightly dilutive in 2013 and accretive beginning in 2014. The        company expects to account for its investment in ACMP using the equity        method. The company plans to provide a full guidance update in February        when it expects to report year-end financial results.                   The company expects to maintain its investment-grade credit ratings.                    Investor Conference Call                    Williams plans a conference call with investors today at 6:30 p.m. EST        to discuss the substance of this news release. A presentation and a link        to the live webcast of today\u2019s event will be available shortly at  www.williams.com .

{"Date": "09/26/2012", "Header": "Williams Signs New Agreement to Provide Gas Processing in Canada\u2019s Oil Sands", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/williams-signs-new-agreement-provide-gas-processing-canadas-oil-sands", "Textbody": "\n     TULSA, Okla.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Williams         (NYSE:WMB) announced today that the company has signed a new long-term        gas processing agreement with a producer in the Canadian oil sands.                   Under the new long-term agreement, Williams will extract, transport,        fractionate, own and market the natural gas liquids (NGLs) and olefins        recovered from the offgas at the oil sands producer\u2019s upgrader near Fort        McMurray, Alberta. Under the agreement, the NGL/olefins recovered are        expected to be approximately 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) by mid-2015        and growing to approximately 15,000 bpd by 2018.                   The NGL/olefins mixture will be fractionated at Williams\u2019 Redwater        facilities into an ethane/ethylene mix, propane, polymer grade        propylene, normal butane, an alkylation feed and condensate. The ethane        price risk associated with this deal is mitigated via the previously        announced long-term agreement to supply NOVA Chemicals Corporation with        up to 17,000 bpd of ethane and ethylene.                   The propane recovered will be sold into the local propane market and        would potentially be used as feedstock at Williams\u2019  proposed        propane dehydrogenation  (PDH) facility in Canada. The other products        will be sold into the established markets where Williams sells existing        NGLs and olefins produced in Canada.                   \u201cThis new agreement will build on the  unique        expertise and large-scale infrastructure  we\u2019ve built in Canada,\u201d        said David Chappell, president of Williams Energy Canada. \u201cThe scale        that we are building here \u2013 with fractionation, distribution and storage        \u2013 gives us the ability to generate significant long-term incremental        value from our operations.                   \u201cThe new operations will also further reduce greenhouse gas and sulphur        dioxide emissions from the upgraders\u2019 oil sands operations, and produce        valuable commodities that were previously being burned,\u201d Chappell said.                    Emissions Reductions                    The offgas processing that  Williams        pioneered  significantly reduces emissions at its customers\u2019 oil        sands production facilities. Williams captures and processes a rich        NGL/olefins mixture that would normally be burned by the oil sands        producer. The producer instead burns methane that Williams provides in        exchange for the NGL/olefins mixture.                   Once full operating capacity is achieved at the producer\u2019s location,        processing the offgas is expected to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide        (CO 2 ) \u2013 a greenhouse gas \u2013 by an average of approximately        200,000 tonnes per year. It is expected to reduce emissions of sulphur        dioxide (SO 2 ) \u2013 a contributor to acid rain \u2013 by an average of        approximately 2,000 tonnes per year.                   When combined with Williams\u2019 existing offgas processing at another        third-party oil sands producer, the company\u2019s operations in Canada will        eventually reduce annual CO 2  emissions by more than 500,000        tonnes and annual SO 2  emissions by 4,500 tonnes.                    New Facilities and Capital Expenditure Guidance                    To support the new agreement, Williams plans to build a new liquids        extraction plant and supporting facilities at the oil sands producer\u2019s        upgrader. It also plans to build an extension of its Boreal Pipeline        that will enable transportation of the NGL/olefins mixture to its        expanded Redwater facility outside of Edmonton.                   The total capital expenditures expected for the project is CA$500        million to CA$600 million. The 2012-14 portions of the capital        expenditures are included in Williams\u2019 latest capital expenditure        guidance, which was issued on Aug. 1.

Operational Update                    The Mobile Bay gas processing plant is ready to begin processing gas as        soon as producer volumes increase and a third-party natural gas liquid        (NGL) pipeline becomes available. The Geismar olefins production        facility plans to resume operations this week following several days of        maintenance unrelated to the storm.                   The Canyon Station offshore platform has resumed normal operations. The        Devils Tower floating production system is flowing some gas production        and is expected to resume normal operations as soon as a crude oil        terminal downstream of the Mountaineer pipeline resumes operations and        an NGL pipeline outlet is available.

Additionally, Williams Partners will be responsible for the completion        of the ongoing expansion of the Geismar facility projected to cost $270        million and additional pipelines projected to cost approximately $160        million.                   Williams also agreed to temporarily waive approximately $16 million per        quarter of general partner incentive distribution rights (IDRs) until        the later of Dec. 31, 2013 or 30 days after the Geismar plant expansion        is operational.

The table below presents a comparison of expected post-expansion segment        profit plus DD&A for 2014 to the transaction price for these assets.        2014 is expected to be the first full year of operations at the Geismar        facility following the expansion, expected to be completed in late 2013.        As a result, 2014 is more representative of the Geismar facility\u2019s        long-term earnings and cash flow generation capacity.

North American ethylene demand is expected to        remain strong, given its continuing advantaged cost compared with        ethylene derived from crude-oil based feedstock.                   Williams Partners expects that the addition of olefins production to its        business via this acquisition will be accretive to distributable cash        flow, on a per-unit basis for the partnership\u2019s unitholders. Williams        Partners plans to fund the acquisition with the issuance to Williams of        42.8 million Williams Partners limited-partner units, $25 million in        cash and an increase to the general partner\u2019s capital account to        maintain Williams\u2019 2-percent general-partner interest. The transaction        is expected to close in early November.                   Williams will gain increased distributions from Williams Partners for        the limited-partner units it will receive as consideration for the        transaction. The increased distributions from Williams Partners support        Williams\u2019 dividend growth strategy.                   Williams currently owns approximately 66 percent of Williams Partners,        including the general-partner interest. Following the closing of this        transaction Williams will own approximately 70 percent of Williams        Partners, including the general-partner interest.                   \u201cThe addition of the Geismar facility to Williams Partners\u2019 portfolio        immediately reduces the partnership\u2019s exposure to the over-supplied        ethane markets by nearly 70 percent and eliminates it by 2014, while        increasing our ability to produce globally marketed ethylene,\u201d said Alan        Armstrong, chief executive officer of the general partner of Williams        Partners. \u201cBringing this natural hedge to Williams Partners makes it        unique among similarly situated MLPs. In addition, it provides strong        support for our continuing distribution growth.\u201d                   Located south of Baton Rouge, La., the Geismar facility is a light-end        natural gas liquid (NGL) cracker with current inlet volumes of 39,000        barrels per day (bpd) of ethane and 3,000 bpd of propane and annual        production of 1.35 billion pounds of ethylene. With the benefit of a        significant expansion under way and scheduled for completion by late        2013, the facility\u2019s consumption of ethane will increase to a maximum of        57,000 bpd and annual ethylene production capacity will grow by 600        million pounds to 1.95 billion pounds. Williams Partners\u2019 overall        undivided ownership interest following the expansion will be        approximately 88 percent.                   Post-expansion segment profit, plus DD&A, for both the Geismar facility        and the pipelines is projected to grow from $270 million in 2013 to $600        million by the end of 2014. The primary drivers of this increase in 2014        earnings and cash flows are the first full-year of expansion volumes, an        assumed increase in spot ethylene prices and increased sales at these        assumed higher ethylene spot prices.                   The pipelines included in the transaction include a 212-mile ethane        pipeline between Lake Charles and Geismar, a three-mile propane        pipeline, a 50-mile pipeline between Port Arthur and Lake Charles, and        60 miles of product pipelines in and around the Houston Ship Channel.                   The Internal Revenue Service recently released a private letter ruling        which stated that income derived from processing NGLs into olefins at        the Geismar facility and the related marketing, transporting and storing        of olefins constitute qualifying income for Williams Partners L.P.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced unaudited third-quarter        2012 net income of $237 million, or $0.38 per common limited-partner        unit, compared with third-quarter 2011 net income of $342 million, or        $0.91 per common limited-partner unit.                   Year-to-date through Sept. 30, Williams Partners reported net income of        $778 million, or $1.47 per common limited-partner unit, compared with        $987 million, or $2.63 per common limited-partner unit, for the first        nine months of 2011.                   The decline in net income during the third quarter and year-to-date 2012        periods is due to a significant decline in natural gas liquid (NGL)        margins, primarily driven by a sharp decline in NGL prices in the second        quarter of 2012, which led to lower results in the partnership\u2019s        midstream business. Other factors, including higher expenses associated        with developing businesses acquired earlier this year, also contributed        to the lower results in 2012. An increase in fee-based revenue,        including a third-quarter 2012 increase of 12 percent in the        partnership\u2019s midstream business, partially offset the negative impacts        of lower NGL prices and other factors.                   There is a more detailed analysis of the partnership\u2019s businesses later        in this news release.                    3Q Distributable Cash Flow                    For third-quarter 2012, Williams Partners generated $316 million in        distributable cash flow, compared with $368 million in third-quarter        2011. For the first nine months of 2012, Williams Partners generated        $1.08 billion in distributable cash flow, compared with $1.21 billion        for the first nine months of 2011.                   The previously noted significant decline in NGL margins was the key        driver of the decline in distributable cash flow. Higher fee-based        revenue in the midstream business partially offset the lower NGL        margins. Although third-quarter 2012 distributable cash flow declined        compared with third-quarter 2011, it increased 8 percent sequentially        compared with the second-quarter 2012 amount of $293 million.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.8075 per unit, an 8 percent        increase over the year-ago amount. As planned, the partnership\u2019s        previously strong cash distribution coverage enabled it to continue its        cash distribution growth during a period of significantly unfavorable        commodity prices. Also, the partnership has issued a significant amount        of equity this year to finance numerous projects that are in the early        stages of development.                    Gulf Olefins Acquisition Expected to Shift Commodity Exposure to        Ethylene, Drive More Certainty in Cash Flows                    In a separate announcement today, Williams Partners and Williams        announced an agreement for Williams Partners to acquire Williams\u2019        83.3-percent interest in the Geismar olefins production facility, as        well as Williams\u2019 refinery-grade propylene splitter and\u00a0pipelines in the        Gulf region, for approximately $2.36 billion. Williams Partners plans to        fund the acquisition with the issuance to Williams of 42.8 million WPZ        limited-partner units, $25 million in cash, and an increase to the        general partner\u2019s capital account to maintain Williams\u2019 2-percent        general-partner interest.                   The partnership expects the addition of olefins production to its        business would bring more certainty to cash flows that today are exposed        to the market for ethane, which is projected to experience periods of        volatility as feedstock demand lags new supplies from shale-gas        production. Low-cost, light-NGL feedstock demand is expected to remain        strong, given its economic advantage over higher-cost crude-oil based        feedstock. Williams Partners will be responsible for the completion of        the ongoing expansion of the Geismar facility. The partnership\u2019s overall        undivided ownership interest in Geismar following the ongoing expansion        will be approximately 88 percent.                   Please see the separate news release for more details on the acquisition.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cIn the third quarter, fee-based revenue in our midstream business grew        12 percent, but that growth was offset by unfavorable commodity prices        and downtime in the Gulf related to Hurricane Isaac.                   \u201cThe acquisition of Williams\u2019 Gulf Olefins assets, which was announced        today, should provide the partnership with some significant benefits. It        will add additional scale to the business, providing greater earnings        and cash flow; but more importantly, it will provide a natural hedge by        neutralizing our exposure to the over-supplied ethane markets.                   \u201cWe\u2019ve updated our guidance to reflect the Gulf Olefins acquisition, as        well as a near-term lowering of our gathering volume growth rate.        However, our long-term focus hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 we continue to be bullish        on long-term natural gas demand growth, and we have visibility to a        diverse set of attractive infrastructure projects.\u201d                    Guidance Updated to Reflect Geismar Drop-Down, Lower Expected Growth        Rate in Gathered Volumes; Strong Distribution Guidance Unchanged                    Williams Partners is updating its 2012-14 earnings, distributable cash        flow and capital expenditure guidance to reflect the acquisition of the        Geismar and Gulf Olefins assets, as well as lower expected overall rate        of growth in gathering volumes.                   Williams Partners\u2019 previous guidance on cash distributions to its        unitholders is unchanged. The partnership continues to expect to pay        unitholders a full-year 2012 distribution of $3.14 per unit at guidance        midpoint, an 8 percent increase over 2011. As well, the partnership        confirmed it expects the midpoint of guidance for the full-year        distribution it pays unitholders in each 2013 and 2014 to increase by 9        percent \u2013 to $3.43 and $3.75, respectively.

                                 Gas Pipeline                    Williams Partners owns two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems        \u2013 Transco and Northwest Pipeline \u2013 and owns 50 percent of Gulfstream.        These systems have a combined peak day delivery capacity of more than 14        billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and transport approximately 14        percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.                   Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $155 million for third-quarter        2012, compared with $170 million for third-quarter 2011. The decline in        the third quarter segment profit was primarily due to an increase in        certain costs, including pipeline maintenance, employee-related, and        selling, general and administrative expenses.                   For the first nine months of 2012, Gas Pipeline reported segment profit        of $482 million, compared with $497 million for the same time period in        2011. The previously noted higher costs, plus higher project feasibility        costs were the primary drivers of the decline in segment profit in the        year-to-date period. Increased transportation revenue associated with        expansion projects and higher equity earnings from an increased interest        in Gulfstream partially offset the negative impacts in the year-to-date        period.                    Midstream Gas & Liquids                    Midstream provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing;        deepwater production handling and oil transportation; and NGL        fractionation, storage and transportation services.                   The business reported segment profit of $218 million for third-quarter        2012, compared with segment profit of $301 million for third-quarter        2011.                   Significantly lower NGL prices, partially offset by lower natural gas        prices, was the primary driver of the lower segment profit in the third        quarter. Higher operating costs and selling, general and administrative        (SG&A) expenses, both partially attributable to developing businesses        acquired earlier this year, also contributed to the lower segment profit        in the third quarter.                   A 12-percent increase in fee-based revenues partially offset the        negative impacts described above. The increase in fee-based revenues was        primarily due to higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale area including        new volumes on the recently acquired Ohio Valley Midstream system and        Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering assets, partially offset by unfavorable        impacts related to Hurricane Isaac in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.                   For the first nine months of 2012, Midstream reported segment profit of        $718 million, compared with $882 million for the first nine months of        2011. The previously mentioned lower NGL prices, partially offset by        lower natural gas prices, as well as lower marketing margins driven by a        significant and rapid decline in NGL prices during the second quarter of        2012, were the primary drivers of the lower segment profit in the first        nine months of 2012. The year-to-date period also was impacted by the        previously noted higher operating and SG&A expenses.                   An increase in fee-based revenues partially offset these factors in the        first nine months of the year. The increase in fee revenues is primarily        due to higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale, including new volumes on        the recently acquired gathering and processing assets in our Ohio Valley        Midstream and Susquehanna Supply Hub businesses; higher volumes in the        western deepwater Gulf of Mexico, including higher volumes on the        Perdido Norte natural gas and oil pipelines; and higher volumes in the        Piceance Basin.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, and adjusted segment profit        \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes adjusted segment profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither adjusted        segment profit nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent        cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to        net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

{"Date": "11/05/2012", "Header": "Williams Partners Completes Acquisition of Williams\u2019 Gulf Olefins Business", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/williams-partners-completes-acquisition-williams-gulf-olefins-business", "Textbody": "\n     TULSA, Okla.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) today announced that it has completed the        transaction to acquire Williams\u2019 (NYSE: WMB) approximately 83-percent        undivided interest in the Geismar olefins production facility, as well        as Williams\u2019 refinery-grade propylene splitter for $2.264 billion and        pipelines in the Gulf region, for $100 million. Additionally, Williams        Partners will be responsible for the completion of the ongoing expansion        of the Geismar facility projected to cost $270 million and additional        pipelines projected to cost approximately $160 million.                   The addition of olefins production to Williams Partners\u2019 business is        expected to bring more certainty to cash flows that were previously        exposed to the market for ethane, which is projected to experience        periods of volatility as feedstock demand for infrastructure lags new        supplies from shale-gas production. North American ethylene demand is        expected to remain strong, given its continuing advantaged cost,        compared with ethylene derived from crude-oil based feedstock.                   Williams Partners expects that the addition of olefins production to its        business via this acquisition will be accretive to distributable cash        flow, on a per-unit basis for the partnership\u2019s unitholders. Williams        Partners funded the acquisition with the issuance to Williams of 42.8        million Williams Partners limited-partner units, $25 million in cash and        an increase to the general partner\u2019s capital account to maintain        Williams\u2019 2-percent general-partner interest.                   Williams gains increased distributions from Williams Partners for the        limited-partner units it received as consideration for the transaction.

Lower natural gas liquid (NGL) margins at Williams Partners drove the        decline in net income during third-quarter 2012. Increased costs        associated with developing businesses Williams Partners acquired earlier        in the year and the absence of a $66 million income tax benefit in        third-quarter 2011 related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign        operations also contributed to the decline. These declines were        partially offset by higher fee-based revenues at Williams Partners.                   For the first nine months of 2012, Williams reported net income of $710        million, or $1.15 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income        of $820 million, or $1.37 per share, for the same time period in 2011.                   The decline in NGL margins at Williams Partners and the absence of both        a $124 million income tax benefit primarily associated with a federal        settlement that was recorded during first-quarter 2011 and the        previously described $66 million income tax benefit in third-quarter        2011 were the primary factors in the decline in net income for the        year-to-date 2012 period. These items were partially offset by gains in        2012 associated with the sale of Williams\u2019 former assets in Venezuela.                   Prior-period results throughout this release have been recast to reflect        the separation of Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business        on Dec. 31, 2011. The results of the former exploration and production        business are reported in discontinued operations for 2011.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $161 million, or $0.25        per share, for third-quarter 2012, compared with $179 million, or $0.30        per share for third-quarter 2011.                   The decline in adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2012 is due to        lower results at Williams Partners driven by the lower NGL margins in        the third quarter and increased costs associated with developing        businesses Williams Partners acquired earlier this year. Despite the        lower results compared with third-quarter 2011, adjusted income from        continuing operations increased 17 percent sequentially over the        second-quarter 2012 results, which was $138 million, or $0.22 per share.                   Year-to-date through Sept. 30, adjusted income from continuing        operations was $535 million, or $0.86 per share, compared with $520        million, or $0.87 per share for the first nine months of 2011.                   The increase in adjusted income from continuing operations for the first        nine months of 2012 was due to improvement in the Midstream Canada &        Olefins segment and decreased interest expense reflecting both corporate        debt retirements in December 2011 and increased capitalized interest        associated with construction projects. Lower results in the Williams        Partners segment significantly offset these benefits in the year-to-date        period.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure.

Williams Partners plans to        fund the acquisition with the issuance to Williams of 42.8 million WPZ        limited-partner units, $25 million in cash, and an increase to the        general partner\u2019s capital account to maintain Williams\u2019 2-percent        general-partner interest.                   Williams expects the transaction will result in increased distributions        from Williams Partners for the limited-partner units it will receive as        consideration for the transaction and related incentive distribution        rights. The increased distributions from Williams Partners supports        Williams\u2019 dividend growth strategy. Additionally, Williams Partners will        be responsible for the completion of the ongoing expansion of the        Geismar facility. Williams Partners\u2019 overall undivided ownership        interest in Geismar following the expansion will be approximately 88        percent.                   Please see the separate news release for more details on the drop-down        transaction.                    Williams Acquires Gulf Coast Pipelines, Plans Development of        Petrochemical Services                    Williams also recently agreed to acquire 12 idle pipelines from        ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) in the Gulf Coast region. The acquired pipelines        will be combined with an organic build-out of several projects that will        expand Williams\u2019 petrochemical services in the Gulf Coast region.                   The projects include significant expansion of the company\u2019s existing        ethylene hub, the establishment of a propylene hub that will connect        propylene customers with Mont Belvieu and establishment of an isobutane        network that will connect to single-sourced or undersupplied customers.        The company will also pursue additional projects using unused portions        of the acquired pipelines. The projects are expected to be placed into        service beginning in late 2014. The business associated with these        services will be reservation-charge, fee-based transportation agreements        with cash flows that support Williams\u2019 dividend growth.                   The capital expenditures for the acquisition, organic build out through        2014 and capitalized interest are approximately $480 million. This        amount is included in Williams\u2019 2012-14 capital expenditure guidance.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cWe continued to see the expected growth in Williams Partners\u2019 fee-based        business in the third quarter, but it was offset by continued        unfavorable commodity prices and significant downtime in the Gulf Coast        assets due to Hurricane Isaac\u2019s impact on company owned and adjacent        facilities.                   \u201cWe are reaffirming our extraordinary dividend growth rate of 55 percent        in 2012, followed by 20 percent growth rate in 2013 and 2014, despite        the unfavorable near-term commodity price environment.                   \u201cOur earnings guidance has been updated to reflect the impact of lower        gas prices on gathering volumes at Williams Partners, as well as the        drop-down of the Gulf Olefins assets into Williams Partners. This        drop-down transaction will strengthen Williams Partners\u2019 cash flows and        significantly increase the cash distributions that Williams receives        from Williams Partners, providing support to our dividend growth rate.                   \u201cOur long-term outlook remains very strong. We continue to have        visibility to a diverse set of attractive infrastructure projects across        our businesses and remain bullish on long-term natural gas demand growth        that will drive our fee-based revenues.\"                    New Guidance Reflects Geismar Drop-Down, Lower Expected Growth Rate        in Gathered Volumes, Other Items; Dividend Guidance Unchanged                    Williams is updating its 2012-14 earnings and capital expenditure        guidance to reflect the drop-down of the Geismar and Gulf Olefins assets        to Williams Partners, as well as lower expected overall rate of growth        in gathering volumes at Williams Partners and other items.                   Williams\u2019 previous guidance on dividends is unchanged. The company        continues to expect to pay a full-year 2012 shareholder dividend of        $1.20 per share, a 55 percent increase over 2011. As well, the company        expects the full-year dividend it pays shareholders in each of 2013 and        2014 to increase by 20 percent \u2013 to $1.44 and $1.75 per share,        respectively.

For third-quarter 2012, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $373 million, compared with $471 million for third-quarter 2011.        Year-to-date through Sept. 30, Williams Partners reported $1.20 billion        in segment profit, compared with $1.38 billion for the same period in        2011.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during the third        quarter and year-to-date 2012 periods is due to a significant decline in        NGL margins, which led to lower results in the partnership\u2019s midstream        business. Other factors, including higher expenses associated with        developing businesses acquired earlier in the year, also contributed to        the lower results in 2012. An increase in fee-based revenue, including a        third-quarter 2012 increase of 12 percent in the partnership\u2019s midstream        business, partially offset the impacts of lower NGL prices and other        factors.                                                             \u00a0                                                   \u00a0

volumes in the Marcellus Shale area including        new volumes on Williams Partners\u2019 recently acquired Ohio Valley        Midstream system and Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering assets, partially        offset by unfavorable impacts related to Hurricane Isaac in the eastern        Gulf of Mexico.                   There is a more detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 interstate        gas pipeline and midstream business results in the partnership\u2019s        third-quarter 2012 financial results news release, which is also being        issued today.                    Midstream Canada & Olefins                    Midstream Canada & Olefins includes Williams\u2019 operations in the United        States and Canada focused on recovering, transporting, storing and        producing ethylene, propylene, NGLs and other related products.                   Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment profit of $72 million for        third-quarter 2012, compared with $73 million for third-quarter 2011.                   The slight decline in segment profit during third-quarter 2012 was due        to lower Canadian NGL and propylene product margins driven by lower        per-unit sales prices. Higher Geismar ethylene product margins resulting        from lower feedstock costs substantially offset these impacts.                   For the first nine months of 2012, Midstream Canada & Olefins reported        segment profit of $243 million, compared with $219 million for the first        nine months of 2011. The increase in segment profit for the first nine        months of 2012 was primarily due to higher Geismar ethylene and other        product sales margins. These items were partially offset by lower        Canadian NGL and propylene product margins and higher operating and        maintenance costs.                    Other                    The Other segment benefited from gains related to the 2010 sale of the        company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela of $53 million in the        year-to-date 2012 period and $11 million in the year-to-date 2011 period.

Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d)        and adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures        as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.        Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per        share measures exclude items of income or loss that the company        characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations. Management        believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into the        company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings, nor adjusted earnings per share measures are intended to        represent an alternative to segment profit, net income or earnings per        share. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for        a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE:WPZ) today announced that it has received        interest from shippers to expand its existing Transco pipeline Leidy        Line in northern Pennsylvania by up to 800,000 dekatherms of natural gas        per day by late 2015.                   Williams (NYSE: WMB) owns approximately 68 percent of Williams Partners,        including the general-partner interest.                   The Leidy Southeast expansion project is being designed to serve the        growing needs of local gas distribution companies and electric power        generators along the Atlantic Seaboard and throughout the southeastern        United States. The company is currently finalizing shipper agreements        and expects to initiate pre-filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory        Commission (FERC) in early 2013. The final scope and cost of the project        will be determined by the results of shipper negotiations.                   \u201cOur Transco Leidy Line is strategically positioned through the heart of        one of the most important natural gas production areas in the country,\u201d        said Randy Barnard, president of Williams Partners\u2019 natural gas pipeline        business. \u201cThis project also leverages Transco\u2019s access to some of the        fastest growing markets in the country. Linking the supply to the demand        could significantly expand the Leidy Line\u2019s currently subscribed firm        capacity of 1,700,000 dekatherms by up to 50 percent.\u201d                   The proposed Leidy Southeast expansion will provide firm transportation        from various supply points along Transco\u2019s Leidy Line to delivery points        terminating at its Zone 4 Market Pool in Alabama, along its mainline        system.                   The Leidy Southeast expansion represents a portion of Williams\u2019        previously announced Atlantic Access project, which proposed firm        transportation options from various Marcellus shale supply regions in        Pennsylvania and West Virginia. A non-binding open season for the        Atlantic Access project resulted in strong interest in expanding        Transco\u2019s Leidy Line, while other portions of the project continue to be        discussed with potential shippers for a later in-service date.

A sharp decline in natural gas liquid (NGL) margins and other factors at        Williams Partners, as well as the absence of $56 million in income from        discontinued operations in second-quarter 2011, drove the decline in net        income during second-quarter 2012.                   For the first half of 2012, Williams reported net income of $555        million, or $0.90 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income        of $548 million, or $0.92 per share, for the same time period in 2011.                   The increase in year-to-date 2012 net income is primarily due to gains        associated with the sale of Williams\u2019 former assets in Venezuela. A        number of factors mostly offset this benefit, including the absence of a        $124 million income tax benefit primarily associated with a federal        settlement that was recorded during first-quarter 2011; and the        previously noted decline in NGL margins at Williams Partners and other        factors during the second quarter of 2012.                   Prior-period results throughout this release have been recast to reflect        the separation of Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business        on Dec. 31, 2011. The results of the former exploration and production        business are reported in discontinued operations for 2011.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $138 million, or $0.22        per share, for second-quarter 2012, compared with $172 million, or $0.29        per share for second-quarter 2011. The second-quarter adjusted results        are $0.01 higher than the estimate of $0.21 per share that the company        provided in its July 23 guidance news release.                   The decline in adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2012 is due        to lower results at Williams Partners driven by the sharply lower NGL        margins and other factors in the second quarter.                   Year-to-date through June 30, adjusted income from continuing operations        was $374 million, or $0.61 per share, compared with $341 million, or        $0.57 per share for the first half of 2011.                   The increase in adjusted income from continuing operations for the first        half of 2012 was due to improvement in the Midstream Canada & Olefins        segment, driven by a strong first quarter, and decreased interest        expense reflecting both corporate debt retirements in December 2011 and        increased capitalized interest at Midstream Canada & Olefins associated        with construction projects. Lower second-quarter results in the Williams        Partners segment partially offset these benefits in the year-to-date        period.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and is a non-GAAP        measure. Reconciliation to the most relevant GAAP measure is attached to        this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cAs we previously announced, the second-quarter results were driven down        by a sharp decline in NGL prices. While we lowered our 2012 and 2013        earnings guidance, we raised our 2014 earnings guidance and reaffirmed        our commitment to delivering strong dividend growth.                   \u201cWe continue to see growth in Williams Partners\u2019 fee-based revenue,        particularly in the partnership\u2019s midstream business, where the        fee-based revenue was up 19 percent during the second quarter; we expect        that trend to continue, as Williams Partners\u2019 fee-based business is        expected to be more than 80 percent of its total business by 2014.                   \u201cFurthermore, the proposed drop-down of the Geismar facility will        significantly benefit both Williams and Williams Partners. We expect to        continue to see volatility in the natural gas-to-ethane spread as        domestic NGL markets go through growth spurts and periods of oversupply        prior to significant new cracking capacity coming online in 2015 and        beyond. This will shift Williams Partners\u2019 commodity exposure from        ethane to ethylene which we expect to be in tighter supply during this        same period.\u201d                    Business Segment Results                    Williams\u2019 business segments for financial reporting are Williams        Partners, Midstream Canada & Olefins, and Other.

                       * A schedule reconciling segment profit to adjusted segment profit        (non-GAAP measures) is available at www.williams.com and as an        attachment to this press release.                     Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; NGL fractionation; and oil        transportation.                   For second-quarter 2012, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $339 million, compared with $471 million for second-quarter 2011.        Year-to-date through June 30, Williams Partners reported $827 million in        segment profit, compared with $908 million for the same period in 2011.                   The decline in Williams Partners\u2019 segment profit during the second        quarter and year-to-date 2012 is primarily due to a significant decline        in NGL prices, primarily in the second quarter of 2012, which led to        lower NGL margins and lower marketing margins in Williams Partners\u2019        midstream business. Other factors also negatively affected the        second-quarter results, including higher expenses, primarily associated        with the partnership\u2019s recent acquisitions. An increase in fee-based        revenue, including an increase of 19 percent in the partnership\u2019s        midstream business, partially offset the negative impacts of lower NGL        prices and other factors.                                                             \u00a0                                                   \u00a0                                                   \u00a0

measure. A reconciliation to the        most relevant measure included in GAAP is attached to this news release.                    The increase in fee-based revenues during second-quarter 2012 was        primarily due to new volumes on Williams Partners\u2019 recently acquired        Ohio Valley Midstream system and Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering assets        in the Marcellus Shale and higher volumes on the Perdido Norte gas and        oil pipelines in the western deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                   As previously announced, Williams Partners maintained its outlook for        strong annual cash distribution growth. It expects an increase of 8        percent in 2012 and 9 percent in both 2013 and 2014 at guidance        midpoints.                   There is a more detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 interstate        gas pipeline and midstream business results in the partnership\u2019s        second-quarter 2012 financial results news release, which is also being        issued today.                    Midstream Canada & Olefins                    Midstream Canada & Olefins includes Williams\u2019 operations in the United        States and Canada focused on recovering, transporting, storing and        producing ethylene, propylene, NGLs and other related products.                   Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment profit of $68 million for        second-quarter 2012, compared with $72 million for second-quarter 2011.                   The slight decline in segment profit during second-quarter 2012 was due        to lower Canadian NGL product margins driven by lower sales volumes and        lower per-unit margins. The lower sales volumes were due to the impact        of filling the new Boreal Pipeline, which was placed into service in        June. These items were mostly offset by higher Geismar ethylene product        margins.                   For the first half of 2012, Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment        profit of $171 million, compared with $146 million for the first half of        2011. The increase in segment profit for the first half of 2012 was        primarily due to strong results in the first quarter, driven by higher        Geismar ethylene product sales margins and higher Geismar butadiene and        other product margins. These items were partially offset by higher        operating and maintenance costs and lower Canadian NGL product margins.                    Other                    The Other segment benefited from gains related to the 2010 sale of the        company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela of $53 million in the        year-to-date 2012 period and $11 million in the year-to-date 2011 period.                    Guidance Unchanged from July 23 Announcement                    Williams\u2019 guidance issued  on        July 23  for dividends, earnings and capital expenditures for 2012-14        is unchanged. Williams continues to expect to pay a full-year 2012        shareholder dividend of $1.20 per share, a 55 percent increase over        2011. As well, the company expects the full-year dividend it pays        shareholders in each of 2013 and 2014 to increase by 20 percent \u2013 to        $1.44 and $1.75 per share, respectively.                   Williams\u2019 revised guidance midpoints for full-year 2012 and 2013 are,        respectively, $1.15 and $1.38 for adjusted earnings per share. For 2014,        the company\u2019s guidance for adjusted earnings per share is a range with        midpoint of $1.95 \u2013 a level 59 percent higher than the $1.23 it reported        in 2011.                   As previously reported on July 23, Williams\u2019 guidance ranges were based        on lower near-term NGL prices resulting from record warm winter, high        third-party ethylene cracker downtime, growing supplies and other        factors.                   Williams continues to expect the influence of NGL prices on its earnings        to diminish over the next few years as it transitions to a business mix        that is increasingly fee-based in its Williams Partners segment. The        company\u2019s 2013 and 2014 earnings expectations reflect that shift to        greater fee-based business; the benefit of projects coming into service;        and some improvement from current NGL market conditions.                   The previously reported increase in 2014 earnings guidance is based on        the ethylene crack spread recovering to the first-half 2012 level, the        strength of the company\u2019s fundamental businesses, growth and some        improvement in NGL prices.                   For capital and investing expenditures, the company\u2019s guidance includes        ranges with midpoints of $6.7 billion in 2012, $3.6 billion in 2013 and        $2.6 billion in 2014. The 2013 and 2014 ranges do not include a number        of potential projects in development that have not yet been placed into        guidance.

Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, fee-based revenues, adjusted income from continuing        operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are        non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities        and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and        adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of income or loss        that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing        operations. Management believes these measures provide investors        meaningful insight into the company's results from ongoing operations.        Fee-based revenues include total revenues less commodity-based and        tracked revenue. Such excluded items can be volatile due to changing        market conditions, which are largely beyond our management\u2019s control.        Fee-based revenues provide investors with information about the growth        of our revenues that are not subject to this volatility.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither fee-based revenues, adjusted segment        profit, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per share measures are        intended to represent an alternative to revenues, segment profit, net        income or earnings per share. They should not be considered in isolation        or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance        with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Williams        Partners L.P.  (NYSE: WPZ) today announced unaudited second-quarter        2012 net income of $193 million, or $0.29 per common limited-partner        unit, compared with second-quarter 2011 net income of $338 million, or        $0.91 per common unit.                   Year-to-date through June 30, Williams Partners reported net income of        $541 million, or $1.11 per common limited-partner unit, compared with        $645 million, or $1.72 per common limited-partner unit, for the first        half of 2011.                   The decline in net income during the second quarter and year-to-date        2012 is due to a significant decline in natural gas liquid (NGL)        margins, primarily in the second quarter of 2012, which led to lower        results in the partnership\u2019s midstream business. Other factors,        including higher expenses, primarily associated with the partnership\u2019s        recent acquisitions also contributed to the lower results in 2012. An        increase in fee-based revenue, including a year-to-date increase of 19        percent in the partnership\u2019s midstream business, partially offset the        negative impacts of lower NGL prices and other factors.                   There is a more detailed analysis of the partnership\u2019s businesses later        in this news release.                    2Q Distributable Cash Flow                    For second-quarter 2012, Williams Partners generated $293 million in        distributable cash flow, compared with $397 million in second-quarter        2011. For the first half of 2012, Williams Partners generated $768        million in distributable cash flow, compared with $838 million for the        first half of 2011.                   The previously noted significant decline in NGL margins was the key        driver of the decline in distributable cash flow. Steady results in the        gas pipeline business and higher fee-based revenue in the midstream        business partially offset the lower NGL margins.                   Williams Partners\u2019 second-quarter 2012 distributable cash flow is        slightly higher than the estimate of $289 million provided in the        partnership\u2019s July 23 guidance news release.                   Williams Partners recently announced that it increased its quarterly        cash distribution to unitholders to $0.7925 per unit, an 8 percent        increase over the year-ago amount. As planned, the partnership\u2019s        previously strong cash distribution coverage enabled it to continue its        cash distribution growth during a period of significantly unfavorable        commodity prices.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cIn the second quarter, our earnings were negatively affected by a        rapid, significant decline in NGL prices based on a number of factors,        including the record-warm winter and high levels of downtime in        third-party ethylene crackers.                   \u201cImportantly, we are reaffirming our commitment to the strong growth in        our annual cash distributions at levels we have previously announced.        That commitment is underpinned by our confidence in the strength of our        fundamental business, continued growth and the results of our actions to        structure our business to significantly strengthen our cash flows and        reduce volatility.                   \u201cWe are making progress toward dramatically growing the share of our        revenues that come from fee-based business, which contributes greatly to        cash-flow certainty. The magnitude of the shift is significant, with        expected fee-based revenues in our midstream business growing nearly 90        percent from 2011 to 2014. In the first half of this year, we grew the        share of revenues from fee-based business by 19 percent in our midstream        business and 10 percent overall.                   \u201cWe also expect the addition of Williams\u2019 Geismar olefins production        facility to our portfolio would contribute to greater revenues,        strengthen our cash flows and reduce volatility in support of our        planned distribution growth.                   \u201cWe announced last week that we plan to pursue an agreement to acquire        the Geismar facility from Williams. That acquisition would transform our        commodity-price exposure from ethane, a North American commodity with        expected price volatility, to ethylene, a commodity that is advantaged        by North America's abundant natural gas and rapidly expanding NGL        supplies. With Geismar in our portfolio, we would expect to immediately        reduce the partnership\u2019s exposure to the ethane market by nearly 70        percent and nearly eliminate it by 2014.\u201d                    Business Segment Performance                    Williams Partners\u2019 operations are reported through two business        segments,  Gas        Pipeline  and  Midstream        Gas & Liquids .

A reconciliation to the        most relevant measure included in GAAP is attached to this news release.                     Gas Pipeline                    Williams Partners owns two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems        \u2013 Transco and Northwest Pipeline \u2013 and owns 50 percent of Gulfstream.        These systems have a combined peak day delivery capacity of more than 14        billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and transport approximately 14        percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.                   Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $147 million for second-quarter        2012, compared with $152 million for second-quarter 2011. The slight        decline in the second quarter segment profit was due to an increase in        project feasibility costs and other expenses that were mostly offset by        an increase in transportation revenue associated with expansion projects        placed into service in 2011.                   For both the first half of 2012 and the first half of 2011, Gas Pipeline        reported segment profit of $327 million. Increased transportation        revenue associated with expansion projects and higher equity earnings        from an increased interest in Gulfstream were offset by increased        project-feasibility costs.                    Midstream Gas & Liquids                    Midstream provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing;        deepwater production handling and oil transportation; and NGL        fractionation, storage and transportation services.                   The business reported segment profit of $192 million for second-quarter        2012, compared with segment profit of $319 million for second-quarter        2011.                   Lower NGL margins and lower marketing margins driven by a significant        and rapid decline in NGL prices were the primary driver of the decline        in segment profit during the second quarter. NGL margins benefited from        lower natural gas prices. Higher expenses primarily associated with the        partnership\u2019s recent acquisitions and accelerated maintenance in the        West, also contributed to lower results in the second quarter.                   A 19-percent increase in fee-based revenues partially offset the        negative impacts described above. The increase in fee-based revenues was        primarily due to new volumes on the recently acquired Ohio Valley        Midstream system and Susquehanna Supply Hub gathering assets in the        Marcellus Shale and higher volumes on the Perdido Norte gas and oil        pipelines in the western deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                   For the first half of 2012, Midstream reported segment profit of $500        million, compared with $581 million for the first half of 2011. The        previously mentioned decline in NGL and marketing margins in the second        quarter was the primary driver of the lower segment profit in the        year-to-date period. The year-to-date period also was impacted by the        previously noted higher expenses related to recent acquisitions and        accelerated maintenance in the West. An increase in fee-based revenues        partially offset these factors in the first half of the year.                    Guidance Unchanged from July 23 Announcement                    Williams Partners\u2019 guidance  issued        on July 23  for distribution growth, distributable cash flow and        capital expenditures for 2012-14 is unchanged.                   The partnership continues to expect to pay unitholders a full-year 2012        distribution of $3.14 per unit at guidance midpoint, an 8 percent        increase over 2011. As well, the partnership confirmed it expects the        midpoint of guidance for the full-year distribution it pays unitholders        in each 2013 and 2014 to increase by 9 percent \u2013 to $3.43 and $3.75,        respectively.                   Williams Partners\u2019 guidance midpoints for full-year distributable cash        flow are $1.6 billion for 2012; $1.9 billion for 2013; and $2.3 billion        for 2014. The partnership\u2019s guidance midpoints for capital and        investment expenditures are $5.9 billion for 2012; $2.7 billion for 2013        and $1.8 billion for 2014.                   As reported in Williams Partners\u2019 July 23 news release, the        partnership\u2019s guidance ranges reflect sharply lower near-term NGL prices        resulting from record warm winter, high third-party ethylene cracker        downtime, growing supplies and other factors. Its 2012 DCF guidance        reflects the effect of significantly lower than expected NGL prices and        higher than normal maintenance capital expenditures.                   The partnership continues to expect the influence of NGL prices on its        performance to diminish over the next few years as it transitions to a        business mix that is largely fee-based. The partnership's 2013 and 2014        performance expectations reflect that shift to greater fee-based        business; the benefit of projects coming into service; and some        improvement from current depressed NGL market prices.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 distributable        cash flow, cash distribution coverage ratio, fee-based revenues, and        adjusted segment profit \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., adjusted segment profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes adjusted segment profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define fee-based revenues as total        revenues less commodity-based and tracked revenue. Such excluded items        can be volatile due to changing market conditions, which are largely        beyond our management\u2019s control. Fee-based revenues provides investors        with information about the growth of our revenues that are not subject        to this volatility.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define distributable cash flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of distributable        cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage        ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither fee-based        revenues, adjusted segment profit nor distributable cash flow are        intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented        as an alternative to revenues, net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

{"Date": "07/19/2012", "Header": "Williams Explores Building First Propane Dehydrogenation Facility in Canada", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/williams-explores-building-first-propane-dehydrogenation-facility-canada", "Textbody": "\n     TULSA, Okla.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Williams         (NYSE:WMB) announced today that it is exploring building a propane        dehydrogenation (PDH) facility in Alberta, Canada. A new PDH facility,        which would be the first in Canada, would allow Williams to        significantly increase its production of polymer-grade propylene from        its Canadian operations. Williams is the only company in Canada        producing polymer-grade propylene, a valuable petrochemical feedstock        used in plastics manufacturing.                   Williams would primarily use the propane it recovers at its Redwater        facility near Edmonton, Alberta, as feedstock for the new PDH facility,        which would convert the propane into higher-value propylene that will be        transported to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The associated hydrogen by-product        would be sold locally in the Alberta market.                   \u201cBuilding a PDH facility would further build on the value and expertise        that we\u2019ve built in Canada and serve the booming North American        petrochemical market,\u201d said David Chappell, president of Williams Energy        Canada. \u201cBesides our expertise in extracting and marketing these        products, we have the infrastructure in place with fractionation,        distribution and storage to fully realize the value from a new PDH        facility.                   \u201cBecause of our existing facilities, we would be able to capture value        from PDH production byproducts \u2013 butane/butylene and ethane/ethylene \u2013        that another PDH operator would have to burn,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve        built a unique business in Canada and we\u2019re continuing to explore ways        to capture more of the off-gas available from existing and planned        upgraders, and to add more value to the products we produce.\u201d                   Williams\u2019 proposed PDH facility in Canada would have an annual capacity        of approximately 1 billion pounds. The company estimates capital        expenditures of approximately $600 million to $800 million that would be        funded primarily with international cash on hand.                    Williams\u2019 Operations in Canada: Innovative Business, Emissions Reducer                    When producers convert the Canadian oil sands into usable oil, the        process produces an off-gas byproduct that includes a rich mixture of        natural gas, NGLs and olefins. Williams  pioneered        the process  of extracting the mixture from the off-gas at its Fort        McMurray, Alberta, facility, which is located on-site at a third-party        oil-sands production facility.                   Williams currently recovers approximately 14,000 barrels per day (bpd)        of an NGL/olefins mixture from its facility in Fort McMurray. The        mixture includes propane, propylene, butane, butylenes and condensate.        Expansions are currently underway that will enable the company to also        recover 10,000 bpd of an ethane/ethylene mix.                   After it extracts the off-gas mixture, Williams returns the        clean-burning natural gas to the third-party oil-sands producer for its        operations. It then transports the remaining NGL/olefins mixture, via        the recently placed into service Boreal Pipeline, to its Redwater        facility outside of Edmonton for further separation.                   Williams\u2019 off-gas processing reduces emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) \u2014        a greenhouse gas \u2014 in Alberta by approximately 0.2 million tons each        year and cuts emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) \u2014 a contributor to acid        rain \u2014 by more than 1,700 tons each year. The new off-gas expansions        will further reduce both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions in        Alberta.                   "},

{"Date": "07/23/2012", "Header": "Williams Partners Reaffirms Distribution-Growth Guidance Despite Lower Commodity Margins and Earnings Guidance", "url": "https://investor.williams.com/press-release/williams/williams-partners-reaffirms-distribution-growth-guidance-despite-lower-commod", "Textbody": "\n     TULSA, Okla.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Williams Partners (NYSE: WPZ) today reaffirmed its previously published        outlook through 2014 for strong growth in the cash distributions it pays        to unitholders, despite lowering its earnings outlook for the same        period to reflect less-favorable commodity prices.                   The partnership continues to expect to pay unitholders a full-year 2012        distribution of $3.14 per unit, an 8 percent increase over 2011. As        well, the partnership confirmed it expects the midpoint of guidance for        the full-year distribution it pays unitholders in each 2013 and 2014 to        increase by 9 percent \u2013 to $3.43 and $3.75, respectively.                   Williams Partners expects its second-quarter distributable cash flow        will be significantly lower than the first-quarter\u2019s results primarily        because of an unexpectedly sharp decline in natural-gas-liquids margins        in May and June. Additional factors in the change include normal        seasonal increases in maintenance capital expenditures; higher expenses        at Midstream because of maintenance accelerated during a third-party        fractionator outage; somewhat lower-than-expected volumes because of        construction timing; costs associated with recent acquisitions; and        normal seasonal demand changes and maintenance at Gas Pipeline. Higher        fee-based revenues partially offset these factors.                   The partnership estimates its second-quarter distributable cash flow        will be approximately $289 million, down from $475 million in the first        quarter this year. The partnership\u2019s estimates of its second-quarter        results are preliminary and subject to change based on completion of its        normal quarter-end review process. As previously announced, the        partnership plans to report its finalized second-quarter financial        results on Aug. 1.                   Williams Partners\u2019 revised guidance midpoints for full-year        distributable cash flow are $1.6 billion for 2012; $1.9 billion for        2013; and $2.3 billion for 2014. The partnership\u2019s 2012 DCF guidance        reflects the effect of significantly lower than expected NGL prices and        higher than normal maintenance capital expenditures. The partnership\u2019s        projected 2014 distributable cash flow is 37 percent higher than its        2011 DCF of $1.7 billion.                   Regarding commodity prices, the partnership referenced an        NGL-to-crude-oil price ratio that is approximately 40 percent below the        10-year average. Key factors in that weakness are high propane        inventories caused by the extremely warm winter and the effect of the        propane oversupply on ethane inventories and pricing.                   The partnership continues to expect the influence of NGL prices on its        performance to diminish over the next few years as it transitions to a        business mix that is largely fee-based. The partnership\u2019s revised 2013        and 2014 performance expectations reflect that shift to greater        fee-based business; the benefit of projects coming into service; and        some improvement from current depressed NGL market prices as excess        inventories are brought into balance as a result of additions to North        American capacity for steam-cracking, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and        exports, as well as more normal weather.

(4) The cash distributions in guidance are on an accrual basis            and reflect an approximate 8% (low), 9% (midpoint), and 10% (high)            increase in quarterly limited partner cash distributions annually            through 2014.                                                \u00a0                                     The increases Williams Partners expects to make in its cash        distributions are subject to quarterly approval by the board of        directors of the partnership\u2019s general partner.                   In other news today, Williams Partners and Williams issued a news        release announcing they are pursuing an agreement for the partnership to        acquire Williams\u2019 83.3 percent interest and operatorship of the        olefins-production facility in Geismar, La.                   The partnership expects that the addition of olefins production to its        business via this acquisition would create significant additional        income, reduce the partnership\u2019s exposure to ethane margins and be        accretive to distributable cash flow, on a per-unit basis for the        partnership\u2019s unitholders.                   As contemplated, Williams Partners would fund the transaction largely        with the issuance of limited-partner units to Williams.                   The transaction is subject to execution of an agreement between the two        parties, review and recommendation by the conflicts committee of the        general partner of Williams Partners, and approval of the two parties\u2019        boards of directors. As a result, the benefits of this planned        transaction are not included in current guidance.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures - Distributable        Cash Flow, Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio, and Adjusted Segment Profit        - that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., Adjusted Segment Profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes Adjusted Segment Profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define Distributable Cash Flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of Distributable        Cash Flow to the total cash distributed (Cash Distribution Coverage        Ratio). This measure reflects the amount of Distributable Cash Flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither Adjusted        Segment Profit nor Distributable Cash Flow are intended to represent        cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to        net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Williams Partners, EnCap Flatrock Midstream of San Antonio, Highstar        Capital of New York, and Caiman management anticipate investing        approximately $800 million to develop natural gas, natural gas liquid        and crude oil gathering and processing infrastructure. The area of focus        will be the natural gas liquid- and oil-rich areas of the Utica Shale in        Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania. Williams Partners\u2019 anticipated share of        the $800 million in potential development is approximately $380 million        over the next several years.                   \u201cThis new midstream venture can leverage the commercial relationships        and success of Caiman\u2019s management and investors, along with Williams        Partners\u2019 long experience in successfully constructing and reliably        operating large-scale midstream infrastructure,\u201d said  Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner.                   \u201cOur producer customers will benefit from introducing the kind of        comprehensive  large-scale        midstream solutions  to the area that will make their positions in        the liquids- and oil-rich Utica Shale even more valuable,\u201d Armstrong        said.                   Jack Lafield, chairman and chief executive officer of Caiman Energy,        LLC, made the following comments:                   \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more pleased to work with such a well-respected company.        Together with our other equity partners, Williams' financial strength        and experience allows Caiman Energy to continue to provide our producer        customers with the best possible midstream solutions as they develop        drilling locations in this exciting play. We see great opportunities in        the Utica Shale and with the successful completion of this equity        transaction, we believe we are well-positioned to expand into the Utica        and elsewhere.\u201d                   The new Utica Shale joint venture will also benefit from close proximity        to Williams Partners\u2019 new Ohio Valley Midstream business. The Ohio        Valley Midstream area of operation is northern West Virginia,        southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Work is under way to expand        existing physical assets, which include a gathering system and a        processing facility. In addition, construction is underway on        fractionation and additional processing facilities and there are plans        to construct NGL pipelines.                   "},

Williams Partners expects that the addition of olefins production to its        business via this acquisition would be accretive to distributable cash        flow, on a per-unit basis for the partnership\u2019s unitholders. As        contemplated, Williams Partners would fund the transaction largely with        the issuance of limited-partner units to Williams.                   The partnership expects the addition of olefins production to its        business would bring more certainty to cash flows that today are exposed        to the market for ethane, which is projected to experience periods of        volatility as demand infrastructure lags new supplies from shale-gas        production. Ethylene demand is expected to remain strong as ethylene is        and is expected to be significantly less expensive than crude-oil based        feedstock.                   Williams owns 68 percent of Williams Partners, including the        general-partner interest.                   Located south of Baton Rouge, La., the Geismar facility is a light-end        natural gas liquid (NGL) cracker with current volumes of 37,000 barrels        per day (bpd) of ethane and 3,000 bpd of propane and annual production        of 1.35 billion pounds of ethylene. With the benefit of a $350-$400        million expansion under way and scheduled for completion by late 2013,        the facility\u2019s annual ethylene production capacity will grow by 600        million pounds to 1.95 billion pounds.                   \u201cAdding the Geismar olefins-production facilities to Williams Partners\u2019        portfolio would immediately reduce the partnership\u2019s exposure to the        ethane market by nearly 70 percent; and it would nearly eliminate it by        2014,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of the general        partner of Williams Partners. \u201cThe business is highly desirable because        it would create greater consistency in our earnings and cash flows. It        provides strong support of our plans for continued growth in the cash        distributions we pay unitholders.\u201d                   The transaction is subject to execution of an agreement between the two        parties, review and recommendation by the conflicts committee of the        general partner of Williams Partners, and approval of the two parties\u2019        boards of directors.                   Along with ethane, propane and ethylene, the Geismar facility also        produces propylene, butadiene and debutanized aromatic concentrate        (DAC). Williams owns 83.3 percent of the Geismar facility and operates        the plant.                   "},

At the same time, the company increased its 2014 outlook for        adjusted earnings per share at a level 59 percent higher than in 2011,        based on the strength of its fundamental business, growth and        improvement in certain commodity prices driven by continued high crude        oil-to-gas ratios.                   Williams continues to expect to pay a full-year 2012 shareholder        dividend of $1.20 per share, a 55 percent increase over 2011. As well,        the company confirmed it expects the full-year dividend it pays        shareholders in each 2013 and 2014 to increase by 20 percent \u2013 to $1.44        and $1.75 per share, respectively. The dividend increases are supported        by growing fee-based business and the benefit of new projects coming        into service, as well as by strong cash coverage. The strength in cash        coverage is designed to provide a significant buffer to periodic        commodity-price volatility and other potential adverse factors.                   For the second quarter this year, Williams expects its adjusted earnings        per share will be significantly lower than the first-quarter\u2019s results,        primarily because of an unexpectedly sharp decline in        natural-gas-liquids margins in May and June at Williams Partners L.P.        (NYSE:WPZ). Additional factors in the change include higher expenses at        Williams Partners because of maintenance accelerated during a        third-party fractionator outage; costs associated with recent        acquisitions; normal seasonal demand changes and maintenance at Williams        Partners\u2019 gas pipeline business; somewhat lower-than-expected volumes        because of construction timing; lower Canadian sales volumes as a result        of third-party outages and the effect of filling our new Boreal        Pipeline, which went into service in late June.                   The company estimates its second-quarter adjusted earnings per share        will be approximately $0.21, down from $0.39 in the first quarter this        year and $0.29 in the second quarter last year. The company\u2019s estimates        of its second-quarter results are preliminary and subject to change        based on completion of its normal quarter-end review process. As        previously announced, the company plans to report its finalized        second-quarter financial results on Aug. 1.                   Williams' revised guidance midpoints for full-year 2012 and 2013 are,        respectively, $1.15 and $1.38 for adjusted earnings per share and $2.9        billion and $3.3 billion for adjusted segment profit plus DD&A.                   Regarding commodity prices, the company referenced an NGL-to-crude-oil        price ratio that was approximately 40 percent below the 10-year average        during the second quarter but recently rebounded somewhat. Key factors        in the NGL market weakness have been high propane inventories caused by        the extremely warm winter and the effect of the propane oversupply on        ethane inventories and pricing.                   Williams continues to expect the influence of NGL prices on its earnings        to diminish over the next few years as it transitions to a business mix        that is increasingly fee-based in its Williams Partners segment. The        company\u2019s 2013 and 2014 earnings expectations reflect that shift to        greater fee-based business; the benefit of projects coming into service;        and some improvement from current NGL market conditions as a result of        additions to North American capacity for steam-cracking, propane        dehydrogenation (PDH) and exports, as well as more normal weather.                   For 2014, the company is increasing is adjusted earnings per share to a        range with midpoint of $1.95 \u2013 a level 59 percent higher than the $1.23        it reported in 2011 \u2013 and $4.1 billion at midpoint of the guidance range        for adjusted segment profit plus DD&A. The company is increasing its        earnings guidance for 2014 primarily due to an expectation that it will        benefit from ethylene crack spreads similar to the first half of 2012        after spreads decline for the balance of this year and in 2013. The        company expects continued high spreads between natural gas and ethylene        due to the substantial pricing advantages over global ethylene derived        from crude-oil based feedstocks.                   Williams\u2019 assumptions for certain energy commodity prices for 2012        through 2014 and the corresponding guidance for the company\u2019s earnings        and capital expenditures are displayed

Williams has        paid a common stock dividend every quarter since 1974.                   In other news today, Williams and Williams Partners L.P. issued a news        release announcing Williams intends to pursue a drop down of its 83.3        percent interest and operatorship of the olefins-production facility in        Geismar, La., to Williams Partners. Williams owns 68 percent of Williams        Partners, including the general-partner interest.                   As contemplated, the Geismar olefins-production facility transaction        would provide Williams with newly issued Williams Partners L.P.        limited-partner units. The transaction is subject to execution of an        agreement between the two parties, review and recommendation by the        conflicts committee of the general partner of Williams Partners, and        approval of the two parties\u2019 boards of directors.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted income from continuing operations (\u201cearnings\u201d)        and adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures        as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.        Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per        share measures exclude items of income or loss that the company        characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations. Management        believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into the        company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings, nor adjusted earnings per share measures are intended to        represent an alternative to segment profit, net income or earnings per        share.

On a continuing basis, improved results in the Williams Partners and        Midstream Canada & Olefins segments were more than offset by the absence        of a $124 million income tax benefit primarily associated with a federal        settlement that was recorded during first-quarter 2011. The absence of        the tax benefit drove the slight decline in income from continuing        operations in first-quarter 2012.                   The increase in first-quarter 2012 net income is primarily due to gains        in discontinued operations associated with the sale of Williams\u2019 former        assets in Venezuela. The agreement to sell those assets  was        announced  on March 26.                   Prior-period results throughout this release have been recast to reflect        the separation of Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business        on Dec. 31, 2011. The results of the former exploration and production        business are reported in discontinued operations for first-quarter 2011.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $236 million, or $0.39        per share, for first-quarter 2012, compared with $169 million, or $0.28        per share for first-quarter 2011.                   The increase in the adjusted income from continuing operations for        first-quarter 2012 was due to improved results in both the Williams        Partners and Midstream Canada & Olefins segments. Higher fee-based        revenues and natural gas liquid (NGL) margins at Williams Partners and        higher ethylene margins at Midstream Canada & Olefins drove the improved        results. There is a more detailed description of the business results        later in this press release.                   Adjusted income from continuing operations reflects the removal of items        considered unrepresentative of ongoing operations and are non-GAAP        measures. Reconciliations to the most relevant GAAP measures are        attached to this news release.

Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; NGL fractionation; and oil        transportation.                   For first-quarter 2012, Williams Partners reported segment profit of        $488 million, compared with $437 million for first-quarter 2011.                   Higher fee-based revenues and NGL margins in the partnership\u2019s midstream        business, as well as improved results in the gas pipeline business,        drove the improvement in the first quarter. A decline in margins related        to the marketing of NGLs for the partnership and third parties, together        with higher selling, general and administrative expenses partially        offset these improvements.                   The improvement in Williams Partners\u2019 gas pipeline business was        primarily due to increased revenue from expansion projects placed into        service in 2011.

A reconciliation to the        most relevant measure included in GAAP is attached to this news release.                    Fee-based revenues in the partnership\u2019s midstream business increased by        19 percent in first-quarter 2012. The increase was driven by higher        volumes in the partnership\u2019s Susquehanna Supply Hub area of the        Marcellus Shale, as well as higher volumes on the Perdido Norte gas and        oil pipelines in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Also, gathering volumes        in the West were higher than first-quarter 2011 when severe winter        weather conditions in the Rockies reduced gas production volumes.                   Lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by lower ethane        prices, as well as an increase in NGL equity volumes sold, drove the        17-percent increase in Williams Partners\u2019 NGL margins in the first        quarter. The decline in NGL margins from fourth-quarter 2011 to        first-quarter 2012 was due to significantly lower ethane prices. A large        number of ethane cracker turnarounds was the primary driver of the lower        ethane prices.                   There is a more detailed description of Williams Partners\u2019 interstate        gas pipeline and midstream business results in the partnership\u2019s        first-quarter 2012 financial results news release, which is also being        issued today.                    Midstream Canada & Olefins                    Midstream Canada & Olefins includes Williams\u2019 operations in the United        States and Canada focused on recovering and producing ethylene,        propylene, NGLs and other related products.                   Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment profit of $103 million for        first-quarter 2012, compared with $74 million for first-quarter 2011.                   Higher per-unit Geismar ethylene production margins, as well as higher        volumes, were the primary driver of the improved segment profit in        first-quarter 2012.                    Other                    The Other segment benefited from gains related to the 2010 sale of the        company\u2019s Accroven investment in Venezuela of $53 million in 2012 and        $11 million in 2011.                    Earnings Guidance Slightly Increased, Dividend Guidance Reaffirmed                    Williams\u2019 2012 and 2014 adjusted earnings per share guidance, issued on        March 19 in conjunction with Williams Partners\u2019 Caiman acquisition, is        being slightly increased. Previous adjusted earnings per share guidance        for 2013 is unchanged.                   Williams\u2019 guidance midpoints for expected adjusted earnings per share        are $1.40 in 2012, $1.55 in 2013 and $1.83 in 2014. The projected        adjusted earnings per share amount of $1.83 in 2014 is a 49-percent        increase over Williams\u2019 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $1.23.                   The company\u2019s capital expenditure outlook for 2012 and 2014 is unchanged        from the guidance issued on March 19. Capital expenditure guidance for        2013 is being increased by $75 million at the midpoint, primarily to        reflect Williams Partners\u2019 Virginia Southside expansion project on the        Transco system.                   The company also continues to expect a full-year 2012 dividend to        shareholders of $1.20 per share. The planned 2012 dividend is a 55        percent increase over the full-year 2011 dividend to shareholders of        $0.775 per share. The company also continues to expect an increase of        its dividend by 20 percent in both 2013 and 2014.

Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, fee-based revenues, adjusted income from continuing        operations (\u201cearnings\u201d) and adjusted earnings per share \u2013 that are        non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities        and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and        adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of income or loss        that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing        operations. Management believes these measures provide investors        meaningful insight into the company's results from ongoing operations.        Fee-based revenues includes total revenues less commodity-based and        tracked revenue. Such excluded items can be volatile due to changing        market conditions, which are largely beyond our management\u2019s control.        Fee-based revenues provides investors with information about the growth        of our revenues that are not subject to this volatility.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, fee-based        revenues, adjusted earnings, nor adjusted earnings per share measures        are intended to represent an alternative to revenues, segment profit,        net income or earnings per share. They should not be considered in        isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Reconciliations to the most relevant measures        included in GAAP are attached to this news release.                    The increase in net income for the first quarter is primarily due to        increases in fee-based revenues in both the midstream and gas pipeline        businesses, as well as higher natural gas liquid (NGL) margins in the        midstream business. There is a more detailed discussion of the midstream        and gas pipeline results in the business segment performance section        below.                    Strong Results Drive Increase in DCF for 1Q 2012                    For first-quarter 2012, Williams Partners generated $475 million in        distributable cash flow, compared with $441 million in first-quarter        2011. The previously noted improvement in the midstream and gas pipeline        businesses drove the 8-percent increase in distributable cash flow for        the first quarter.                    CEO Perspective                     Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cThe partnership performed very well in the first quarter, with recent        expansion projects driving strong increases in fee-based revenue.                   \u201cWe also completed an equity offering and are poised to close the  Caiman        acquisition . That acquisition, along with our expanding  Susquehanna        Supply Hub , will position Williams Partners as the leading        infrastructure solution provider in the Marcellus Shale.                   \u201cWe\u2019re also very well positioned to capture the transportation growth        being driven by increased demand for gas-fired power generation. Power        generation is the driver behind about a third of the volumes in proposed        projects in development on our  Transco        pipeline . We anticipate three Transco expansion projects coming        online this year.\u201d                    Business Segment Performance                    Williams Partners\u2019 operations are reported

A reconciliation to the        most relevant measure included in GAAP is attached to this news release.                     Gas Pipeline                    Williams Partners owns interests in three major interstate natural gas        pipeline systems \u2013 Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream. These        systems have a combined peak day delivery capacity of more than 14        billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and transport approximately 14        percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.                   Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $180 million for first-quarter        2012, compared with $175 million for first-quarter 2011.                   Higher transportation revenues associated with expansion projects placed        into service in 2011 drove the improved results in the first quarter.        The absence in 2012 of a reversal of project feasibility costs from        expense to capital which occurred in 2011 and higher selling, general        and administrative expenses partially offset the higher transportation        revenues in first-quarter 2012.                    Midstream Gas & Liquids                    Midstream provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing;        deepwater production handling and oil transportation; and NGL        fractionation, storage and transportation services.                   The business reported segment profit of $308 million for first-quarter        2012, compared with segment profit of $262 million for first-quarter        2011.                   A 19-percent increase in fee-based revenues, as well as higher NGL        margins, drove the improved results in first-quarter 2012. A decline in        margins related to the marketing of NGLs for the partnership and third        parties, together with higher general and administrative expenses        partially offset the higher fee-based revenues and NGL margins in the        first quarter.                   The increase in Midstream\u2019s fee-based revenues was driven by higher        volumes in the partnership\u2019s Susquehanna Supply Hub area of the        Marcellus Shale, including additions from the  February        acquisition  of the Laser Northeast Gathering System. Higher volumes        on the Perdido Norte gas and oil pipelines in the deepwater Gulf of        Mexico also contributed to the higher fee-based revenues. Also,        gathering volumes in the West were higher than first-quarter 2011 when        severe winter weather conditions in the Rockies reduced gas production        volumes.                   Lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by lower ethane        prices, as well as an increase in NGL equity volumes sold, drove the        17-percent increase in NGL margins in the first quarter. The decline in        NGL margins from fourth-quarter 2011 to first-quarter 2012 was due to        significantly lower ethane prices. A large number of ethane cracker        turnarounds was the primary driver of the lower ethane prices.                    Slight Change to 2013 Capital Expenditures, Other Previous Guidance        Unchanged                    Williams Partners is increasing its 2013 capital expenditure guidance by        $75 million at guidance midpoint, primarily to reflect the  Virginia        Southside  expansion project on Transco. Previous earnings and        capital expenditure guidance for 2012 and 2014, which were issued on        March 19 in conjunction with the Caiman acquisition, is unchanged.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 Distributable        Cash Flow, Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio, Fee-based Revenues, and        Adjusted Segment Profit \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as        defined under the rules of the SEC.                   For Williams Partners L.P., Adjusted Segment Profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes Adjusted Segment Profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define Fee-based Revenues as total        revenues less commodity-based and tracked revenue. Such excluded items        can be volatile due to changing market conditions, which are largely        beyond our management\u2019s control. Fee-based revenues provides investors        with information about the growth of our revenues that are not subject        to this volatility.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define Distributable Cash Flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of Distributable        Cash Flow to the total cash distributed (Cash Distribution Coverage        Ratio). This measure reflects the amount of Distributable Cash Flow        relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio        calculated using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither Fee-based        Revenues, Adjusted Segment Profit nor Distributable Cash Flow are        intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented        as an alternative to revenues, net income or cash flow from operations.        They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a        measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States        generally accepted accounting principles.

New rates        will become effective Jan. 1, 2013. Northwest can file another rate case        in three years and must file within five years. The settlement is in        line with Williams Partners\u2019 and Williams\u2019 earnings and cash flow        guidance for 2013 and 2014.                   Northwest Pipeline is a primary artery for the transmission of natural        gas to the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Region. The 4,000-mile        system crosses Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.        Peak capacity is 3.8 billion cubic feet per day. Northwest\u2019s        bi-directional system provides markets with access to British Columbia,        Alberta, Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin gas supplies.                   "},

(NYSE:WPZ) has completed its previously announced        acquisition of Caiman Energy\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Caiman Eastern        Midstream, LLC. The acquisition provides Williams Partners with a        significant footprint and growth potential in the natural gas        liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus Shale.                    Williams         (NYSE:WMB) owns approximately 68 percent of Williams Partners, including        the general-partner interest.                   \u201cWith the completion of this major acquisition, we\u2019re well on our way to        become the leading provider of gathering, processing and transportation        solutions for producers in the Marcellus Shale,\u201d said  Alan        Armstrong , chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner.                   The acquisition establishes Williams Partners\u2019 new Ohio Valley Midstream        business. The operation area is northern West Virginia, southwestern        Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Work is under way to expand the existing        physical assets, which include a gathering system and a processing        facility. In addition, construction is underway on fractionation and        additional processing facilities and there are plans to construct        natural gas liquid (NGL) pipelines.                   The new business is anchored by long-term contracts, including gathering        dedications totaling 236,000 acres from 10 producers. In addition, there        are processing commitments in place for 100 million cubic feet per day.                   Williams Partners plans to operate its Ohio Valley Midstream business        from West Virginia. The partnership has put an experienced management        team in place, along with approximately 50 former Caiman Eastern        employees, to facilitate continued operations and expansions. It plans        to continue to add staff locally.                   Williams Partners and the owners of Caiman Energy are continuing work to        create a joint venture to develop midstream infrastructure in the NGL-        and oil-rich areas of the Utica Shale, primarily in Ohio and northwest        Pennsylvania.

Williams Partners funded the approximate $2.4 billion purchase price of        the Caiman Eastern acquisition with a combination of approximately $1.72        billion in cash, net of purchase price adjustments, and the issuance to        Caiman of approximately 11.8 million Williams Partners common units.                    Williams Partners in the Marcellus                    The Caiman Eastern acquisition builds on Williams Partners\u2019 strategy to        develop large-scale infrastructure that connects Marcellus Shale        producers\u2019 natural gas and NGLs to the best markets.                   Across the Marcellus Shale, the partnership has gathering dedications on        1.2 million acres. It expects gathering volumes there to reach 5 Bcf/d        by 2015.

In western Pennsylvania, Williams Partners owns a 51-percent interest        and operates the Laurel Mountain Midstream joint venture. Laurel        Mountain includes a gathering system of nearly 1,400 miles of pipeline        with a capacity of approximately 230 MMcf/d.

(NYSE: WPZ) and Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG),        today announced the execution of precedent agreements for a proposed        121-mile pipeline designed to connect natural gas production in        northeastern Pennsylvania with northeastern markets by spring 2015.                   Cabot Oil & Gas has committed to transport 500,000 dt/day (dekatherms        per day), while Southwestern Energy Services Company, a subsidiary of        Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) has agreed to transport 150,000        dt/day for a total takeaway capacity of 650,000 dt/day (enough natural        gas to serve about 3 million homes).                   The new 121-mile Constitution Pipeline is being designed to connect        Williams Partners\u2019 gathering system in Susquehanna County, Pa., to the        Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in        Schoharie County, NY. Williams Partners will own 75 percent of        Constitution Pipeline and, through its affiliates, will provide        construction, operation and maintenance services for the new pipeline.        Cabot will own the remaining 25 percent.                   Williams (NYSE:WMB) owns 69 percent of Williams Partners.                   The pipeline will be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory        Commission (FERC). In anticipation of filing a certificate application        with the FERC in early 2013, Constitution Pipeline Company requested        that FERC initiate a pre-filing environmental review of the pipeline        proposal. The FERC pre-filing process is intended to solicit early input        from citizens, governmental entities and other interested parties to        identify and address issues with potential facility locations.

When calling 811, callers are connected to a local one call center,        which notifies the appropriate utility or pipeline company of the intent        to dig. Professional locators are sent to the requested digging site to        mark the approximate locations of underground lines with flags or spray        paint at no cost to the homeowner.

One call is a free service, but digging without calling 811 can        potentially disrupt service to an entire neighborhood, harm you and        those around you and result in fines and repair costs.

Williams is also announcing a significant acceleration of the planned        increase in dividends to its shareholders. It is raising its expected        full-year 2012 dividend to shareholders from $1.09 per share to $1.20        per share. The new amount is a 55 percent increase over the full-year        2011 dividend to shareholders of $0.775 per share. The company is also        now expecting to increase its dividend by 20 percent in both 2013 and        2014.                   The company is accelerating its planned dividend increases as a result        of  Williams        Partners \u2019 Caiman acquisition and because it now expects a        significant, sustained contribution to the dividend from its Midstream        Canada & Olefins segment. Midstream Canada & Olefins includes Williams\u2019        operations in the United States and Canada focused on recovering and        producing ethylene, propylene, NGLs and other related products.                   The expected quarterly increases in Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to        quarterly approval of Williams\u2019 board of directors.                    Support for Williams Partners Acquisition                    Williams intends to make an additional investment in Williams Partners        of approximately $1 billion to facilitate the Caiman acquisition.        Williams intends to purchase approximately 16.3 million Williams        Partners limited-partner units at a price equal to the price of the        units Williams Partners will issue to Caiman. Please see the        partnership\u2019s news release today for complete details on the acquisition.                   Williams plans to fund its additional equity investment in Williams        Partners with a combination of public equity, debt and available cash.        Williams has also agreed to temporarily waive through 2013 the general        partner incentive distributions with respect to Williams Partners\u2019        limited-partner units to be issued to Caiman and Williams. Williams        estimates the foregone IDRs would have yielded approximately $26 million        in 2012 and $42 million in 2013.                   Williams remains committed to preserving its investment-grade credit        metrics. The comprehensive financing plan is consistent with Williams\u2019        focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet.                   \u201cWilliams Partners\u2019 Caiman acquisition and the comprehensive and        balanced financing plan that we have put together is a great example of        how our MLP strategy supports delivering high dividends and high growth        to our shareholders,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive        officer. \u201cWilliams brings a strong set of capital resources that can        help drive substantial growth opportunities at Williams Partners, which        benefits both entities.\u201d                    Guidance Update                    Williams\u2019 2012-13 guidance is also being updated and 2014 guidance is        being introduced. The new guidance reflects the Caiman acquisition\u2019s        expected contribution of approximately $40 million, $200 million and        more than $400 million in Williams Partners\u2019 adjusted segment profit        plus DD&A in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Williams expects the        segment profit plus DD&A contribution to continue increasing        substantially beyond the current 2012-14 guidance period. Williams is        also increasing its expectation for NGL margins in 2012-13 based on        lower expected natural gas prices.                   Williams expects Williams Partners\u2019 Caiman acquisition to be strongly        accretive to cash flow and earnings per share in 2014 and beyond.        Williams expects to receive cash distributions of approximately $1.5        billion from Williams Partners in 2014, a 65-percent increase over the        approximately $910 million it received from Williams Partners in 2011.                   Williams\u2019 new guidance midpoints for expected adjusted earnings per        share are $1.35 in 2012, $1.55 in 2013 and $1.80 in 2014. The projected        adjusted earnings per share amount of $1.80 in 2014 is a 46-percent        increase over Williams\u2019 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $1.23.                   Capital expenditure guidance for 2012-13 is being updated for Williams        Partners\u2019 Caiman acquisition\u2019s purchase price and expected post-closing        growth capital expenditures are approximately $500 million in 2012 and        approximately $590 million in 2013. Approximately $250 million in growth        capital expenditures associated with the Caiman acquisition are planned        for 2014.

Adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings and adjusted earnings per share measures exclude items of        income or loss that the company characterizes as unrepresentative of its        ongoing operations.

This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company's performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding.

(NSYE:WPZ) today announced it has agreed to acquire        Caiman Energy\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Caiman Eastern Midstream LLC,        for approximately $2.5 billion. The acquisition will provide Williams        Partners with a significant footprint and growth potential in the        natural gas liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus Shale.                    Williams         (NYSE:WMB) owns 72 percent of Williams Partners, including the        general-partner interest. Caiman Energy is backed by private equity        investors including EnCap Flatrock Midstream, EnCap Investments L.P. and        Highstar Capital.                   Caiman Eastern Midstream is an independent gathering and processing        business located in northern West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania        and eastern Ohio. Caiman\u2019s existing physical assets include a gathering        system, two processing facilities and a fractionator. Expansions to the        gathering system, processing facilities and fractionator are currently        under construction. An ethane pipeline is also planned.                   The assets are anchored by long-term contracted commitments, including        236,000 dedicated gathering acres from 10 producers in West Virginia,        Ohio and Pennsylvania.                   Williams Partners expects significant growth in gathering volumes and        NGL production from these assets. There is an estimated 300 trillion        cubic feet (Tcfe) of natural gas in place within a 35-mile radius of the        system, and a significant amount remains undedicated. The partnership        expects the Caiman system to gather more than 2 billion cubic feet per        day (Bcf/d) and produce approximately 300,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of        NGLs and condensate by 2020. It expects the acquisition to be accretive        to projected distributable cash flow attributable to partnership        operations per LP unit by 2013, with substantial projected growth        thereafter.                    Joint Venture to Develop Utica Shale Infrastructure                    Williams Partners is also announcing it intends to participate in a new        joint venture with Caiman Energy and its investors and management to        develop midstream infrastructure in the NGL- and oil-rich areas of the        Utica Shale, primarily in Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania.                    CEO Perspective                    \u201cThese new assets, anchored by long-term agreements with a diverse set        of customers, give us a major presence in the liquids-rich portion of        the Marcellus Shale,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of        Williams Partners\u2019 general partner. \u201cWe expect significant long-term        growth potential because the liquids-rich gas makes this area the most        economical and top-performing play for producers in North America.                   \u201cIt\u2019s also just adjacent to the rich gas and oil-producing portions of        the Utica Shale, where we\u2019re planning on developing new infrastructure        with Caiman. Our goal is to be the leading gathering, processing and        transportation solution provider for producers in the Marcellus Shale.                   \u201cWe\u2019re putting together the kind of infrastructure that makes drilling        in the Marcellus even more desirable for producers because we provide        large-scale infrastructure solutions that connect producers\u2019 natural gas        and natural gas liquids to the best markets.\u201d                   Jack Lafield, president and CEO of Caiman Energy, made the following        comments:                   \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that this transaction will achieve a strong return for        our investors at EnCap and Highstar Capital. We're very proud of the        sizable rich gas system we've built in the Marcellus and the great        relationships Caiman has developed with producers and the people of West        Virginia. The Williams name is synonymous with excellence and superior        customer service. We're excited to turn over our gathering and        processing assets to the Williams team. Williams has a unique ability to        build on the value we've created in the Marcellus. They will serve our        customers and the people of West Virginia with distinction.                   \u201cToday also marks the beginning of an exciting new alliance with        Williams Partners,\u201d Lafield said. \u201cWe're looking forward to working with        Williams in the Utica Shale to bring midstream infrastructure to Ohio        for producers working in this dynamic and rapidly evolving play. When        you combine our management team and the expertise of both our companies        in gas gathering, processing and NGLs, with our shared commitment to        community and customer-focused solutions, it\u2019s clear that Caiman and        Williams are a powerful team.\u201d                    Transaction Terms and Funding                    Williams Partners plans to fund the purchase price of the acquisition        with a combination of $1.78 billion in cash and the issuance to Caiman        of approximately 11.8 million Williams Partners common units valued at        approximately $720 million. The partnership expects to fund the cash        portion of the transaction with a combination of equity, debt and        available cash. Williams Partners has entered into a commitment with        respect to a $1.78 billion interim liquidity facility with UBS        Investment Bank which would be available to fund the full cash purchase        price for the acquisition.                   Williams intends to make an additional investment in Williams Partners        of approximately $1 billion to facilitate the acquisition. Williams        intends to purchase approximately 16.3 million Williams Partners        limited-partner units at a price equal to the price of the units        Williams Partners will issue to Caiman. Williams has also agreed to        temporarily waive the general partner incentive distributions through        2013 with respect to the limited-partner units to be issued to Caiman        and Williams. Williams estimates the foregone IDRs would have yielded        approximately $26 million in 2012 and $42 million in 2013.                   Williams Partners and Williams remain committed to retaining        investment-grade credit metrics.                   The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory filings and        approvals. The partnership expects to complete the acquisition in the        second quarter of 2012.                    Guidance Update                    Williams Partners is providing an update to its 2012-13 guidance and        introducing its initial 2014 guidance.                   The new guidance reflects the Caiman acquisition\u2019s expected contribution        of approximately $40 million, $200 million and more than $400 million in        adjusted segment profit plus DD&A in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.        Williams Partners expects the segment profit plus DD&A contribution to        continue increasing substantially beyond the current 2012-14 guidance        period. Williams Partners is also increasing its expectation for NGL        margins in 2012-13 based on lower expected natural gas prices.                   Capital expenditure guidance for 2012-13 is being updated to reflect the        Caiman acquisition\u2019s purchase price and expected post-closing growth        capital expenditures of approximately $500 million in 2012 and        approximately $590 million in 2013. Approximately $250 million in growth        capital expenditures associated with the Caiman acquisition are planned        for 2014.                   Williams Partners is also increasing its expectation for its regular        cash distributions to limited-partner unitholders in 2013. The        partnership expects to deliver approximately 8 percent annual growth in        distributions for 2012 and 8-10 percent annual growth for 2013 and 2014.                   Williams Partners\u2019 updated 2012-14 commodity price assumptions and        guidance data is available in today\u2019s presentation posted at  www.williamslp.com/investors .                    Advisors                    Jefferies and UBS Investment Bank acted as financial advisors to        Williams Partners and Gibson Dunn acted as legal counsel to Williams        Partners. Additionally, UBS Investment Bank is acting as sole arranger        for the Williams Partners interim liquidity facility.                   Barclays and Citigroup acted as financial advisors to Caiman Energy and        Vinson & Elkins acted as legal counsel to Caiman.                    Williams Partners in the Marcellus                    This acquisition builds on Williams Partners\u2019 strategy to build        large-scale infrastructure in the Marcellus Shale. It is currently        building the Susquehanna Supply Hub in northeastern Pennsylvania, a        major natural gas supply hub that will be capable of delivering more        than 3 Bcf/d of Marcellus Shale production into four major interstate        gas pipeline systems.                   Williams Partners\u2019 gathering system in northeastern Pennsylvania        currently covers three counties and has a capacity of 750 MMcf/d. With        the recent start-up of the Springville pipeline, it is now connected to        three major interstate gas pipeline systems \u2013 Williams Partners\u2019 Transco        system, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Millennium Pipeline. The recently        announced 120-mile Constitution Pipeline will connect Williams Partners\u2019        Susquehanna Supply Hub to the Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee        Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, NY.                   Williams Partners\u2019 Transco interstate gas pipeline system runs through        eastern Pennsylvania and has several expansion projects in the area.        Among those is the proposed Atlantic Access project, which would        significantly expand direct access for Marcellus and Utica Shale natural        gas to additional, growing U.S. markets by late 2014.                   Williams Partners also owns a 51-percent interest and operates the        Laurel Mountain Midstream joint venture in western Pennsylvania. Laurel        Mountain includes a gathering system of nearly 1,400 miles of pipeline        with a capacity of approximately 230 MMcf/d.                    Conference Call with Investors                    Williams Partners and Williams are hosting a conference call with        investors tomorrow at 9 a.m. EDT to discuss the acquisition and new        guidance. A presentation and a link to the live webcast of tomorrow\u2019s        event will be available shortly at  www.williams.com         and  www.williamslp.com .        A limited number of phone lines will be available at (888) 438-5449.        International callers should dial (719) 457-0349.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes a certain financial measure \u2013 adjusted        segment profit \u2013 that is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under        the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment        profit excludes items of income or loss that the company characterizes        as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations. Management believes this        measure provides investors meaningful insight into the company\u2019s results        from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of this non-GAAP        financial measure to its nearest GAAP financial measure. Management uses        this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial        indicator used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Adjusted segment profit is intended to represent        an alternative to segment profit. It should not be considered in        isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(NYSE: WPZ) is seeking binding commitments for the        remaining capacity on Atlantic Access, a proposed expansion of its        Transco interstate pipeline. The project would significantly expand        direct access for Marcellus and Utica Shale natural gas to additional,        growing U.S. markets by late 2014. The partnership has a binding        precedent agreement from a shipper for half of the initial capacity.                   Transco is holding an open season from Feb. 3 to April 2, 2012, to        obtain binding shipper commitments for Atlantic Access. The project        would connect natural gas supplies originating in western West Virginia        and Pennsylvania to valuable markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic,        Southeast and Gulf Coast regions. The project is part of the        partnership\u2019s strategy to provide clean, abundant and domestic natural        gas and reliable energy infrastructure to growing markets in North        America.

The company has        already entered a binding precedent agreement with an anchor shipper for        900,000 Dth/day of capacity in the project.                   The proposed project facilities include approximately 350 miles of new        pipeline extending from Marshall County, W.V., and Butler County, Pa.,        to Williams\u2019 Transco compressor station 195 located in York County, Pa.        Williams\u2019 Transco interstate pipeline system stretches from the prolific        Gulf Coast up the East Coast to serve major markets in Washington, D.C.,        Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.                   Customers subscribing to capacity on the project can choose from three        separate paths originating from Marshall County, W.V., Butler County,        Pa., or Bergen County, N.J. Each of the three paths would transport gas        southward on the existing Transco system to all points on the mainline        and terminating in Transco rate zone 3 in Beauregard Parish, La.                   The capacity, scope and cost of the Atlantic Access project will be        shaped by the results of the open season. The proposed project will be        subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory commission and        other agencies.

Net income for 2011 and 2010 reflect significant losses from        discontinued operations. These losses were primarily due to significant        non-cash property impairment and other charges associated with Williams\u2019        former exploration and production business.                   Williams reported 2011 income from continuing operations of $803        million, or $1.34 per share, compared with income from continuing        operations of $104 million, or $0.17 per share in 2010. Higher fee-based        revenues and higher natural gas liquid (NGL) margins at  Williams        Partners  along with lower early debt retirement costs drove the        significant increase in income from continuing operations in 2011.                   In 2011, Williams recorded pre-tax impairment charges to discontinued        operations of approximately $576 million associated with certain natural        gas properties of the former exploration and production business as well        as a $179 million impairment of Williams\u2019 investment in the former        exploration and production business at the time of the spinoff.                   The full-year 2010 period included charges to discontinued operations of        approximately\u00a0$1 billion\u00a0for an impairment of goodwill and pre-tax        impairment charges of\u00a0$678 million\u00a0related to certain natural gas        properties, both related to the former exploration and production        business. Full-year 2010 also included $645 million of pre-tax charges        in first-quarter 2010 in conjunction with the strategic restructuring        that transformed Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) into a leading        diversified master limited partnership.                   For fourth quarter 2011, Williams reported a net loss of $444 million,        or a loss of $0.74 per share, compared with net income of $174 million,        or $0.29 per share for fourth quarter 2010. The net loss in the fourth        quarter was due to the previously noted impairment charges associated        with the former exploration and production business and $271 million of        early debt retirement costs.                   Prior-period results throughout this release have been recast to reflect        the separation of Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business        on Dec. 31, 2011. The former exploration and production businesses\u2019        results are being reported in discontinued operations.                    Adjusted Net Income                    Williams\u2019 adjusted net income for 2011 was $929 million, or $1.55 per        share. This measure is presented on a basis comparable to 2011 earnings        guidance released on Nov. 1, 2011, prior to the  WPX        Energy spin-off . This amount includes the adjusted results of        Williams\u2019 former exploration and production business.                    Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations                    Adjusted income from continuing operations was $734 million, or $1.23        per share, for 2011, compared with $537 million, or $0.91 per share for        2010. This measure reflects reporting WPX Energy\u2019s results in        discontinued operations. It does not correspond with 2011 earnings        guidance provided on Nov. 1, 2011.                   For fourth quarter 2011, Williams\u2019 adjusted income from continuing        operations was $214 million, or $0.36 per share, compared with $180        million, or $0.30 per share for fourth quarter 2010.                   The significant increase in the adjusted income from continuing        operations for 2011 was due to improved results in both the Williams        Partners and Midstream Canada & Olefins segments. There is a more        detailed description of the business results later in this press release.                   Adjusted net income and adjusted income from continuing operations        reflect the removal of items considered unrepresentative of ongoing        operations and are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most        relevant GAAP measures are attached to this news release.                    CEO Comment                     Alan        Armstrong , Williams\u2019 president and chief executive officer, made the        following comments:                   \u201cOur infrastructure businesses performed extremely well in 2011, driving        a 35-percent increase in adjusted EPS for the year and generating more        than $2 billion in adjusted segment profit.                   \u201cWe were also very successful in 2011 in both signing new business and        making significant progress on major expansion projects across our        businesses. On top of all of that, we completed the separation of our        E&P business, transforming Williams into a high-dividend, high-growth        energy infrastructure company.                   \u201cOur full-year 2012 planned dividend to shareholders will be 41 percent        higher than the full-year 2011 level, and we continue to expect robust        distributions from Williams Partners that will drive dividend growth at        Williams.                   \u201cWe\u2019re also expecting 12 percent adjusted EPS growth through 2013        despite an expectation of lower NGL margins and we\u2019re working on a        number of large-scale projects that we expect to drive significant        growth beyond the guidance period.                   \u201cWilliams Partners is well on its way to creating a 3 Bcf/d natural gas        supply hub in northeast Pennsylvania; it also has other major projects        underway in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and along the Transco pipeline.        We also have significant expansions underway in our olefins business in        both Canada and the U.S.\u201d                    Williams Partners\u2019 Laser Acquisition Drives Increase in Guidance                    Williams is increasing its capital expenditure and adjusted segment        profit guidance for 2012-13 to reflect Williams Partners\u2019  acquisition         of the Laser Northeast Gathering System. Capital expenditure guidance        for 2012-13 has also been updated to reflect Williams Partners\u2019  Constitution        Pipeline project . Higher expected ethylene margins at Midstream        Canada & Olefins also contributed to the increased segment profit        guidance in 2013.

is        available at  www.williams.com         and as an attachment to this press release.                     Williams Partners                    Williams Partners is focused on natural gas transportation, gathering,        treating, processing and storage; NGL fractionation; and oil        transportation.                   For 2011, Williams Partners reported segment profit of $1.90 billion,        compared with $1.57 billion for 2010. For fourth quarter 2011, Williams        Partners reported segment profit of $517 million, compared with $418        million for the same period in 2010.                   Higher NGL margins and higher fee-based revenues in the partnership\u2019s        midstream business, as well as improved results in the gas pipeline        business, drove the significant improvement in both the full-year and        fourth-quarter periods.                   The improvement in Williams Partners\u2019 gas pipeline business was        primarily due to increased revenue from expansion projects placed into        service in 2010 and 2011.                   Fee-based revenues in the partnership\u2019s midstream business increased by        12 percent in 2011. This improvement was driven by new gathering        business in the Marcellus Shale, increased throughput on the Perdido        Norte gas and oil pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and a rate increase in        the Piceance Basin associated with an agreement executed in November        2010.                   Full-year per-unit NGL margins for 2011 were $0.83 per gallon, an        increase of 46 percent over the full-year 2010 amount of $0.57 per        gallon.

Midstream Canada & Olefins                    Midstream Canada & Olefins includes Williams\u2019 operations in the United        States and Canada focused on recovering and producing ethylene,        propylene, NGLs and other related products.                   Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment profit of $296 million for        2011, compared with $172 million for 2010. For fourth quarter 2011,        Midstream Canada & Olefins reported segment profit of $77 million,        compared with $49 million for fourth quarter 2010.                   Higher Canadian NGL margins from butylene/butane mix products helped        drive the improvement in the full-year and fourth-quarter results. The        separate products produced by the company\u2019s Canadian butylene/butane        splitter placed in service in August 2010 provide a higher combined        per-unit margin than the butylene/butane mix product sold previously.        Additionally, product sales prices and sales volumes increased.                   Higher per-unit margins on Canadian propane and propylene and Geismar        ethylene also contributed to the improved results in both 2011 periods.        Fourth-quarter 2011 segment profit also benefited from a $19 million        adjustment related to a litigation matter.                   Midstream Canada & Olefins has two major expansion projects in Canada        and one in the U.S. currently under way.                    The        Boreal Pipeline , which is a 12-inch diameter pipeline in Canada that        will transport recovered NGLs and olefins from the extraction plant in        Fort McMurray to the fractionator in Redwater, is expected to be placed        into service in the second quarter of this year. An ethane recovery        project is also under way in Canada that will enable Williams to        initially recover and process 10,000 barrels per day of an        ethane/ethylene mix in Canada. That project is expected to be placed        into service in 2013.                   Williams is also in the process of  expanding         its Geismar olefins production facility. The expansion is expected to        increase the facility\u2019s ethylene production capacity by 600 million        pounds per year to a new annual capacity of 1.95 billion pounds. The        expansion is expected to be placed into service in 2013.

The company will host the year-end Q&A live webcast on Thursday, Feb. 23        at 9:30 a.m. EST. A limited number of phone lines will be available at        (800) 967-7144.

Form 10-K                    The company plans to file its 2011 Form 10-K with the Securities and        Exchange Commission next week. Once filed, the document will be        available on both the SEC and Williams websites.                    Non-GAAP Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 adjusted        segment profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted per share \u2013 that are        non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities        and Exchange Commission. Adjusted segment profit, adjusted earnings and        adjusted per share measures exclude items of income or loss that the        company characterizes as unrepresentative of its ongoing operations.        Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight        into the company's results from ongoing operations.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare a company\u2019s performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the company and aid        investor understanding. Neither adjusted segment profit, adjusted        earnings nor adjusted per share measures are intended to represent an        alternative to segment profit, net income or earnings per share. They        should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of        performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted        accounting principles.

The increases in net income for the full-year and fourth-quarter 2011        periods are primarily due to higher natural gas liquid (NGL) margins in        the  midstream        business  and increased fee-based revenues in the midstream and gas  pipeline        businesses . There is a more detailed discussion of the midstream and        gas pipeline results in the business segment performance section below.                    Strong Results, Asset Acquisitions Drive 42-percent Increase in DCF        for 2011                    For 2011, Williams Partners\u2019 distributable cash flow attributable to        partnership operations was $1.65 billion, compared with $1.16 billion        for 2010. The 42-percent increase in DCF attributable to partnership        operations in 2011 was due to the previously noted strong results in the        midstream business, as well as the growth of the partnership via asset        acquisitions in the second half of 2010.                    Susquehanna Supply Hub                    Williams Partners recently announced the new Constitution Pipeline joint        venture and the completion of the Laser Northeast Gathering System        acquisition. These two milestones are the latest steps in Williams        Partners\u2019 strategy to create the  Susquehanna        Supply Hub , a major natural gas supply hub in northeastern        Pennsylvania.                   By 2015, Williams Partners expects the Susquehanna Supply Hub to be        capable of gathering and delivering more than 3 billion cubic feet per        day (Bcf/d) of Marcellus Shale production into four major interstate gas        pipeline systems.                    CEO Perspective                    Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general        partner, made the following comments:                   \u201cThe partnership performed exceptionally well in 2011, with        distributable cash flow up more than 40 percent over 2010.

Gas Pipeline                    Williams Partners owns interests in three major interstate natural gas        pipeline systems \u2013 Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream. These        systems have a combined peak day delivery capacity of more than 14        billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and transport approximately 14        percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.                   Gas Pipeline reported segment profit of $673 million for 2011, compared        with $637 million for 2010. For fourth quarter 2011, Gas Pipeline        reported segment profit of $176 million, compared with $159 million for        fourth quarter 2010.                   Higher transportation revenues associated with expansion projects placed        into service in 2010 and 2011 drove the improved results in full-year        and fourth-quarter periods. Higher operating and depletion, depreciation        and amortization expenses partially offset the higher transportation        revenues.                   Williams Partners is working on four expansion projects that it expects        to be placed into service in 2012.                   The Mid-South Expansion Project involves an expansion of the Transco        mainline from Station 85 in Choctaw County, Ala., to markets as far        downstream as North Carolina. The first phase of the project is expected        to be placed into service in the third quarter of this year with a        second stage placed into service in 2013. When complete, it will        increase capacity by 225 Mdth/d.                   The Mid-Atlantic Connector Project involves an expansion of the Transco        mainline from an existing interconnection with East Tennessee Natural        Gas in North Carolina to markets as far downstream as Maryland. It is        expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter, and it will        increase capacity by 142 Mdth/d.                   The Cardinal System Expansion project involves an expansion of the        Cardinal Pipeline which is an intrastate pipeline located in North        Carolina. The expansion will add 199 Mdth/d of capacity and is expected        to be placed into service in the second quarter. Williams Partners has a        45 percent ownership interest in this asset.                   The partnership is also working on the North Seattle Lateral Delivery        Expansion on Northwest Pipeline, which will be placed into service later        this year. Williams Partners has executed agreements with a customer for        the project to provide additional lateral capacity of approximately 84        Mdth/d.                    Midstream Gas & Liquids                    Midstream provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing;        deepwater production handling and oil transportation; and NGL        fractionation, storage and transportation services.                   The business reported segment profit of $1.22 billion for 2011, compared        with segment profit of $937 million for 2010. For fourth quarter 2011,        Midstream reported segment profit of $341 million, compared with $259        million for the same period in 2010.                   Higher NGL margins and fee-based revenues drove the improvement in both        the full-year and fourth-quarter periods. Higher operating expenses,        including depreciation, partially offset the higher NGL margins and        fee-based revenues in both periods. Higher NGL prices were the driver of        the increased NGL margins in both periods.                   Midstream\u2019s fee-based revenues increased by 12 percent in 2011. This        improvement was driven by new gathering business in the Marcellus Shale,        increased throughput on the Perdido Norte gas and oil pipelines in the        Gulf of Mexico and a rate increase in the Piceance Basin associated with        an agreement executed in November 2010.                                                             \u00a0

were $0.83 per gallon, an        increase of 46 percent over the full-year 2010 amount of $0.57 per        gallon.                   In addition to the previously discussed Susquehanna Supply Hub, the        midstream business will continue work on several ongoing expansion        projects in 2012 and beyond in all of its major locations.                   Williams Partners has two major deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects under        way. Construction has commenced on the Gulfstar FPS TM , a        spar-based floating production system with a capacity of 60,000 barrels        of oil per day, up to 200 MMcf/d of natural gas and the capability to        provide seawater injection services. Williams Partners has  signed        multiple agreements  with Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) and Chevron        (NYSE: CVX) to utilize Gufstar FPS for production handling, export        pipeline, oil and gas gathering and gas processing services in the        Tubular Bells field development located in the eastern deepwater\u00a0Gulf of        Mexico. The project is expected to be in service in 2014.                   Discovery, of which Williams Partners owns 60 percent, plans to        construct the  Keathley        Canyon Connector , a 20-inch diameter, 215-mile subsea natural gas        gathering pipeline for production from the Keathley Canyon, Walker Ridge        and Green Canyon areas in the central deepwater Gulf of Mexico.        Discovery has signed long-term agreements with the Lucius and Hadrian        South owners for natural gas gathering and processing services for        production from those fields.                    Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures                    This press release includes certain financial measures \u2013 Distributable        Cash Flow, Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio, and Adjusted Segment Profit        \u2013 that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the        Securities and Exchange Commission.                   For Williams Partners L.P., Adjusted Segment Profit excludes items of        income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing        operations. Management believes Adjusted Segment Profit provides        investors meaningful insight into Williams Partners L.P.'s results from        ongoing operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we define Distributable Cash Flow as net        income plus depreciation and amortization and cash distributions from        our equity investments less our earnings from our equity investments,        distributions to noncontrolling interests and maintenance capital        expenditures. We also adjust for payments and/or reimbursements under        omnibus agreements with Williams and certain other items. Total        Distributable Cash Flow is reduced by any amounts associated with        operations, which occurred prior to our ownership of the underlying        assets to arrive at Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partnership        operations.                   For Williams Partners L.P. we also calculate the ratio of Distributable        Cash Flow attributable to partnership operations to the total cash        distributed (Cash Distribution Coverage Ratio). This measure reflects        the amount of Distributable Cash Flow relative to our cash distribution.        We have also provided this ratio calculated using the most directly        comparable GAAP measure, net income.                   This press release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP        financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management        uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial        indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In        addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an        enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Partnership's        assets and the cash that the business is generating. Neither Adjusted        Segment Profit nor Distributable Cash Flow are intended to represent        cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to        net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered        in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in        accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

Williams, including its assets held through Williams Partners L.P.        (NYSE: WPZ), is now an energy infrastructure company focused on        connecting North America\u2019s significant hydrocarbon resource plays to        growing markets for natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and olefins.

Williams in 2012 and Beyond \u2013 By the Numbers                    Williams\u2019 interstate gas pipeline and domestic midstream interests are        largely held through its significant investment in Williams Partners        L.P., one of the largest energy master limited partnerships. Williams        owns the general-partner interest and a 73-percent limited-partner        interest in Williams Partners.                   Williams Partners\u2019 three major interstate gas pipelines (Transco,        Northwest Pipeline, Gulfstream) run 15,000 miles and deliver        approximately 14 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United        States. With a combined design capacity of more than 14 billion cubic        feet per day (Bcf/d), these pipelines transport enough natural gas in        one day to serve the needs of more than 30 million homes. The        partnership\u2019s large-scale midstream business includes approximately        1,000 miles of natural gas liquid (NGL) transportation pipelines, and        more than 10,000 miles of oil and gas gathering pipelines. The        partnership\u2019s midstream facilities have daily gas processing capacity of        6.6 Bcf of natural gas and NGL production of more than 200,000 barrels        per day.                   Williams also owns a growing Canadian midstream and domestic olefins        production business. The company\u2019s facilities in Canada process the        off-gas created by the oil sands production into 14,000 barrels per day        of an NGL/olefins mixture. Expansions to those facilities are underway,        as well as construction of a new Canadian NGL pipeline. Williams\u2019        Geismar facility in Louisiana currently produces 1.35 billion pounds of        ethylene annually. It is also in the process of being expanded to        further serve the petrochemical industry.

Discovery intends to construct the Keathley Canyon Connector, a 20-inch        diameter, 215-mile subsea natural gas gathering pipeline for production        from the Keathley Canyon, Walker Ridge and Green Canyon areas in the        central deepwater Gulf of Mexico.                   Discovery has signed long-term agreements with the Lucius and Hadrian        South owners for  natural        gas gathering and processing services  for production from those        fields.                   The Keathley Canyon Connector will originate in the southeast portion of        the Keathley Canyon area and terminate into Discovery\u2019s 30-inch diameter        mainline near South Timbalier Block 283.

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced two major milestones in        its strategy to create a major natural gas supply hub in northeastern        Pennsylvania.  Williams         (NYSE: WMB) owns 72 percent of Williams Partners.                   Williams Partners is announcing a new interstate gas pipeline joint        venture with  Cabot        Oil & Gas Corporation  (NYSE:COG). The new 120-mile Constitution        Pipeline will connect Williams Partners\u2019 gathering system in Susquehanna        County, Pa., to the Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline        systems in Schoharie County, NY. Williams Partners will own 75 percent        of Constitution Pipeline and, through its affiliates, will provide        construction, operation and maintenance services for the new pipeline.        Cabot will own the remaining 25 percent.                   The new pipeline will initially be designed to transport at least        500,000 dekatherms per day of Cabot\u2019s Marcellus production, but will be        expandable to meet growing demand for takeaway capacity in northeast        Pennsylvania. See the information below about an open season to gauge        additional shipper interest.                   Constitution Pipeline will be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory        Commission (FERC). Williams Partners expects to initiate the FERC        application process soon.                   Williams Partners also has completed the acquisition of the Laser        Northeast Gathering System and other midstream businesses from Delphi        Midstream Partners, LLC. The  original        acquisition  along with additional pipeline construction was funded        with $329 million in cash and approximately 7.5 million Williams        Partners units.                    Susquehanna Supply Hub                    These two projects are key steps in Williams Partners\u2019 strategy to        create the Susquehanna Supply Hub, a major natural gas supply hub in        northeastern Pennsylvania.                   By 2015, Williams Partners expects the Susquehanna Supply Hub to be        capable of delivering more than 3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of        Marcellus Shale production into four major interstate gas pipeline        systems.                   \u201cWe are developing all the key elements of a major new supply area hub,        where we can provide Marcellus Shale producers in northeast Pennsylvania        with a large-scale gathering system that has significant takeaway        capacity to the best available markets,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief        executive officer of Williams Partners\u2019 general partner. \u201cIt\u2019s key to        our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure and continuing to        build on our significant fee-based midstream and gas pipeline        businesses.\u201d                   Williams Partners\u2019 gathering system in northeastern Pennsylvania        currently covers three counties and has a capacity of 750 million cubic        feet per day (MMcf/d).

The first-quarter 2012 dividend is more than double the $0.125 per share        the company paid to shareholders  a        year ago . The most recent quarterly dividend the company paid was        $0.25 in December 2011.                   Williams plans to increase its dividend more frequently \u2013 with increases        every quarter. As a result, the company increased its full-year dividend        forecast to $1.09 per share for 2012. That is 41 percent higher than the        full-year dividend Williams paid in 2011. The company\u2019s previous 2012        dividend forecast was $1.03 per share.                   Moving to quarterly increases is consistent with the expected growing        cash distributions Williams is receiving from its significant ownership        interest in  Williams        Partners L.P.  (NYSE:WPZ). Strong business fundamentals and growth        outlook within Williams Partners\u2019  businesses         are driving the expectation of continued strong distribution growth.                   Williams previously stated that it plans to dividend substantially all        of the cash distributions it receives from Williams Partners, less        taxes, interest and other expenses. Additionally, Williams continues to        expect 10 to 15 percent increases in its dividend on an annual basis.        Consistent with that guidance, Williams expects to pay a dividend in        December 2012 that is 14 percent higher than what it paid in December        2011.                   The company expects the cash flows from its  Midstream        Canada & Olefins  segment to be reinvested in that business        during 2012-13 to drive growth opportunities. It expects cash flows from        Midstream Canada & Olefins will contribute to shareholder dividends in        2014 and beyond.                   The expected quarterly increases in Williams\u2019 dividend are subject to        quarterly approval of Williams\u2019 board of directors.                   Williams has paid a common stock dividend  every        quarter since 1974 .                   "},

(NYSE: WPZ) today announced another significant        milestone in building large-scale infrastructure in the Marcellus Shale        with the start up of its Springville natural gas gathering pipeline.                   The Springville pipeline connects Williams Partners\u2019 growing gathering        system in northeast Pennsylvania with its Transco  interstate        gas pipeline , initially moving 300 million cubic feet per day        (MMcf/d) of natural gas to the valuable Northeast markets. The project        is a key component of the partnership\u2019s strategy to provide Marcellus        producers with reliable  large-scale        infrastructure  and connect them to key markets.                    Williams         (NYSE: WMB) owns 75 percent of Williams Partners, including the        general-partner interest.                   \u201cThe Springville system is part of our strategy to offer natural gas        producers in this part of the Marcellus Shale independent, market-based        solutions to gather production and deliver it to the growing Northeast        markets,\u201d said  Rory        Miller , senior vice president of Midstream for Williams Partners.        \u201cWe expect to double the initial takeaway capacity on Springville by the        end of this year by adding compression,\u201d Miller said.                   \u201cThis project is a prime example of our intense focus on expanding our        services to meet our customers\u2019 demand for reliable infrastructure        services,\u201d Miller added.                   The 33.5-mile, 24-inch Springville pipeline transports natural gas from        Williams Partners\u2019 existing gathering system in Susquehanna County, Pa.,        to its Transco interstate gas transmission system in Luzerne County, Pa.                    Williams Partners\u2019 Growing Scale in Marcellus Shale                    Since mid-2009 Williams Partners has acquired two major gathering        systems in Pennsylvania and is in the process of acquiring a third. It        has been quickly working to expand its operations in all areas.                   Williams Partners\u2019  gathering        system in northeast Pennsylvania , which includes the Springville        pipeline, now covers three counties \u2212 Susquehanna, Wyoming and Luzerne \u2013        and is connected to three interstate market outlets \u2013 Tennessee Gas        Pipeline, Millennium Pipeline and Williams Partners\u2019 Transco pipeline.        At the close of 2011, the company reached a new milestone moving more        than 600 MMcf/d of natural gas in this region of the Marcellus Shale.                   The partnership\u2019s  recently        announced agreement  to acquire the Laser Northeast Gathering System        from Delphi Midstream Partners, LLC, will further add to its scale in        northeastern Pennsylvania. The Laser Gathering System is currently        comprised of 33 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline and associated        gathering facilities in\u00a0Susquehanna County, Pa., as well as 10 miles of        gathering pipeline in southern New York. The acquisition, which was        announced on Dec. 22, 2010, is expected to close in the first quarter.                   Work also continues on the Laurel Mountain Midstream joint venture in        southwestern Pennsylvania. The system  was        acquired in 2009  and the partnership has been working to expand and        upgrade the system. It has added 110 miles of additional gathering        pipeline, and it expects another 50 miles to be added by the end of the        first quarter.                   "}
