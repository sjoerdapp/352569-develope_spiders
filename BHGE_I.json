It specializes in the assembly and repair of electric submersible pumps (ESPs) components, including motors, seals, intakes, gas separators and pumps, and has competencies for testing all types and ranges of pumps and motors to ensure quality control. \n\n Established in an area of over 8,500 square meters, the complex has over 1,670 square meters allocated for workshops. Underlining BHGE\u2019s commitment to grow its local footprint and supply chain, the facility achieves near 100 percent Omanization. A team of nine Omani Assembly Maintenance Operations technicians, who were trained at BHGE\u2019s center in Jebel Ali in the UAE, are leading the operations of the facility.  \n\n In addition to supporting existing projects with PDO, the new facility can also support other customers in the country and region, underscoring the added value it brings to the oil and gas supply chain in Oman. \n\n Abdul-Amir Abdul-Hussein Al Ajmi, External Affairs and Value Creation Director at PDO, said:  \u201cThe facility further reinforces our localization efforts to support our In-Country Value strategy which aims to create more job, training and learning opportunities for Omanis and enhance domestic supply chains.\u00a0The facility will provide efficiencies to PDO as well as minimize any delays in equipment delivery and installation, while optimizing the full ESP value chain. We are pleased to work with BHGE as a partner with proven expertise in country.\u201d \n\n The opening of the facility, under the auspices of His Excellency Salim bin Nasser Al Aufi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Oil and Gas, marks the completion of another of the opportunities outlined in the Ministry of Oil and Gas ICV strategic blueprint which was unveiled in 2013. PDO is leading on 38 out of the 53 originally unveiled to Oman\u2019s oil and gas industry. \n\n Ayman Khattab, CEO South Gulf and East Africa at BHGE , said: \u201cThe inauguration of our first artificial lift assembling and repair facility in Oman reflects our long-term commitment to the country and to strengthen our local footprint through in-country investments. With our artificial lift systems recording strong market share in the country, the new facility enables us to be closer to our partners and to serve them more efficiently. We are particularly delighted that the facility opens with nearly 100 percent Omanization, highlighting our commitment to local talent development.\u201d  \n\n \u201cIn Oman, BHGE is striving to present innovative solutions backed by efficient service standards, which help enhance production and optimize costs. This is underlined by BHGE\u2019s strong enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies and the artificial lift solutions ranging from ESPs to gas lift systems and others already deployed in country. The facility is capable of carrying out full investigations on pulled pumps and redesign to enhance and increase their run life.\u201d \n\n BHGE has a long history of operations in Oman, having established its first ESP at a PDO field in the 1980s as well as mobilized its first wireline logging unit. BHGE commenced drilling horizontal wells for PDO in 1990 and in eight years completed the drilling of its 1,000th horizontal well in the country. The company\u2019s goal is to assemble all ESP components locally and to support its customers to achieve higher levels of efficiency and productivity.  \n\n In addition to ESP systems, the BHGE artificial lift portfolio includes rod lift systems, progressing cavity pumping systems, gas lift systems, and horizontal surface pumping systems. \n\n -ends- \n\n \u00a0 \n\n About Petroleum Development Oman: \n\n Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is the leading exploration and production company in the Sultanate of Oman.

The fullstream offering includes a wide range of capabilities in drilling services, subsea equipment, gas processing topsides, gas compression and turbomachinery as well as installation and commissioning services. \u00a0As part of the fullstream package, BHGE was also able to bring its expertise to offer a financial solution to enable Twinza to complete appraisal drilling and proceed to FID. \r\n \r\nThe deal leverages the fullstream capabilities of the newly combined BHGE that provides customers with a \u201cwing to wing\u201d partner in complex projects \u2013 from reservoir evaluation to production and end use. The enhanced portfolio positions BHGE to create new sources of value by improving productivity and economics through integrated equipment and service offerings and meet customer needs through a fullstream lens. \r\n \r\nLorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of BHGE said: \u201cBHGE\u2019s competitive advantage is its ability to serve customers across the entire oil and gas value chain, providing cutting-edge technology and proven expertise to maximize customers\u2019 business profitability. This project with Twinza is one of the first times we can truly show the value of combining our legacy strength into one unique fullstream offering.\u201d \r\n \r\n\u201cHaving a single point of contact and a complete offering for a complex project was one of the key reasons why we partnered with BHGE,\u201d said Huw Evans, CEO of Twinza. \u201cWith its fullstream capabilities, BHGE was able to propose a fully integrated services and equipment offering using a modular state of the art approach, high tech solutions and systems that \u2018talk to each other\u2019 for optimization. This greatly synergizes the execution of the project while reducing the integration risk if we had engaged several vendors for similar services and equipment.\u201d \r\n \r\nPasca is the first offshore oil and gas development in PNG that will produce natural gas liquids (NGLs) in the form of condensate (a light crude oil) and LPG, and will also produce natural gas. The project is expected to spur development of relevant offshore skills and services in PNG and will prove a significant boost to the PNG economy, providing government revenues, utilizing local services and providing local employment. Additionally, the LPG produced from Pasca will be available to reduce imports, and will offer a competitive alternative to imported diesel fuel for power generation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n \r\nTwinza holds 100% of the Pasca A License and has submitted a development plan for the field that will produce the resource across two phases. Phase I consists of the initial production of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including condensate and LPG, with reinjection of dry gas ahead of Phase II. During Phase II, dry gas will be exported. \r\n \r\n"},

In the first stage, the advanced modular gas processing solution will be deployed to dehydrate and compress flare gas to generate over 100 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of gas. \r\n \r\nThe Nassiriya plant will then be expanded to a complete natural gas liquid (NGL) facility to recover 200 MMSCFD of dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and condensate. The project will create direct and indirect jobs for Iraqis and help grow the local supply chain requirements that support Iraqi small and medium enterprises. \r\n \r\nThe modular solution will also support power plants with dry gas for efficient power generation, thus helping meet the growing demand for electricity using clean fuel. The project will also contribute to curtailing the amount of gas flared in the fields of Nassiriya and Gharraf that otherwise goes to waste. \r\n \r\nThe hundreds of thousands of tons per year of LPG and condensates produced will help meet the domestic demand for cooking gas. The surplus LPG and condensate will be exported, generating high revenue to the Iraqi government.  Contributing to the social and economic development of Nassiriya, the project is aligned with the vision of the Ministry of Oil and the government. \r\n \r\nHis Excellency Jabbar Al-Luaibi, the Iraq Minister of Oil, said that the Ministry is moving ahead to implement its strategic plans to secure financial revenue to the treasury of the Iraqi state and to develop the oil industry.  The statement came at the ceremony hosted by the Ministry to sign a contract for the project to invest in an optimum solution to recover flare gas in the fields of Nassiriya and Gharraf with Baker Hughes, a GE Company. \r\n \r\nRami Qasem, President, MENAT and India, Baker Hughes, a GE Company, said: \u201cThe Iraqi Ministry of Oil has outlined a clear vision and strategy to maximize the utilization of natural resources, especially gas. As a full-stream company that combines physical and digital strengths to increase reliability and uptime across the entire spectrum of oil and gas development, we bring advanced solutions that can support in transforming the industry and contribute to all-round development through our in-country investments in Iraq. We are committed to supporting the Ministry of Oil in its strategic goals, and in deploying advanced flare gas solutions and to build the country\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure. From industrial to economic and environmental benefits our solutions will create long-term value for the country.\u201d \r\n \r\nLast year, BHGE had signed a first-of-its-kind partnership agreement with the Ministry of Oil to strengthen the performance of the Iraq energy sector by providing advanced equipment, technology upgrades, maintenance of the Ministry of Oil fleet and ensuring knowledge transfer, skills development and local jobs. \r\n \r\nBHGE has also strengthened its localization initiatives in Iraq with the expansion of its technical services facility in the North Rumaila oilfield.

Each almost the size of a football field, these would be the first micro-LNG plants in Italy and among the first of their kind in Europe.  \n\n Total annual combined production from the four plants could be ca.140,000 Tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or bio-LNG (liquefied biomethane obtained from the organic fraction of urban waste or from agricultural and agro-industrial biomass), further enhancing the Italian production of renewable natural gas with zero CO 2   emissions for the transport sector.  \n\n The potential future investment for the four plants is in the order of 50 to 80 million euros in the coming years, pending the result of the study. The agreement also includes the opportunity to develop further micro-liquefaction plants in Italy and abroad.  \n\n Snam CEO Marco Alver\u00e0 said:  \u201cWith this agreement   we want to give a further impetus to the spread of sustainable mobility and to the decarbonisation of the entire heavy transport sector throughout Italy. Our goal, in particular, is to make a decisive contribution to the diffusion of a new concept of mobility from renewable sources thanks to biomethane and bio-LNG. The entry into the micro-LNG segment \u2013 which can liquefy pipeline gas and biomethane -\u00a0 leverages Snam\u2019s European leadership in gas infrastructure and its existing presence in natural gas mobility, which is expected to be a growth market for gas consumption worldwide and where Snam may be able to export its competencies.\" \n\n Lorenzo Simonelli, Chairman and CEO of BHGE, said: \u201cWe know that low carbon fuel sources will continue to play an important role in enabling a seamless transition to a more sustainable energy mix. This agreement further demonstrates the strength of BHGE\u2019s fullstream portfolio of advanced technologies and service solutions for the gas market as well as proven expertise in the micro-LNG sector. We will work in close partnership with Snam to develop solutions that lower emissions and support the rejuvenation and sustainability of the heavy transport sector. We are uniquely positioned to collaborate and deploy our broad range of capabilities, industry-leading systems, and fuel-efficient technology the boost productivity and reduce the carbon footprint of operations.\u201d \n\n LNG for heavy transport is a rapidly expanding sector: the number of vehicles that use this fuel in Italy has increased from less than 100 to about 1,000 units since 2015. The number of stations supplying LNG has reached 20 units.  \n\n The construction of four new micro-liquefaction plants and therefore the availability of LNG throughout the national territory would support an increase in the number of LNG trucks circulating (potentially bringing it to about 15,000 units in the next years), facilitating the development of low-carbon transport also in Central and Southern Italy.  \n\n LNG is an immediately available solution to eliminate particulate from heavy duty trucks and maritime transport, and reduce CO 2  emissions from these sectors. Bio-LNG is the only currently available solution\u00a0for fully-renewable zero CO 2  fuels for heavy duty transport.   \n\n *** \n\n \u00a0 \n\n Snam contacts \n\n ufficio.stampa@snam.it \n\n +39 02 37037273 \n\n \u00a0 \n\n BHGE contacts \n\n Stephanie Cathcart: +1 202 637 4108,  stephanie.cathcart@BHGE.com   \n\n Silvia Danti: +44 782788 2812,  silvia.danti@BHGE.com   \n\n \u00a0 \n\n \u00a0 \n\n About Snam \n\n Snam is Europe\u2019s leading gas utility.

This is a critical issue in mature fields with declining production rates, where operators are challenged to improve or maintain economics, or areas in which operators are penalized or rewarded based on their power usage. The Magnefficient PMM eliminates induction losses, lowering system power consumption by up to 20% and reducing motor power loss by as much as 67%. With lower idle amps, the PMM allows for better control at lower loads than traditional induction motors. \n\n The motor also delivers a higher power density, which allows operators to use a smaller motor to achieve the same horsepower levels as those achieved with an induction motor. With more power per length, the PMM helps eliminate the need for tandem connections, improving reliability while allowing for faster installations and reducing nonproductive time. This combination of high-energy density and a shorter motor allows the PMM to be placed deeper in slimhole and deviated wellbores, closer to the production zone, to broaden the ESP\u2019s operational flexibility and improve recovery rates through greater reservoir pressure draw down. \n\n On a recent job, an operator in Argentina used the Magnefficient PMM to reduce lifting costs and improve efficiency in a marginal, mature field. During seasonally cold conditions, government regulations required the company to provide natural gas to the local grid for heating, which limited the amount  of gas available to generate power to the field. BHGE recommended trialing the Magnefficient PMM to reduce power consumption and to achieve the required 200 horsepower without the need for tandem motor connections. At half the length of the traditional induction motor system, the PMM system was assembled 2.3 times faster. The PMM also increased overall motor efficiency by more than 26% and allowed the operator to achieve a 23% reduction in power costs. This generated energy savings between 15-26%, encouraging the operator to deploy five additional systems in the coming months.  \n\n Ends \n\n \u00a0 \n\n "},

Our industry will face challenges as it navigates continued market volatility, evolving policy priorities and cost pressure but we cannot forget our focus on productivity or allow old habits to return. \n\n \u201cThese deals and partnerships show the value of BHGE\u2019s diversified portfolio, which allows us to partner with our customers and develop innovative solutions across the value chain. Our fullstream and integrated offerings are what differentiate us to compete in every segment and sector \u2013 upstream, midstream and downstream, brownfield and greenfield, onshore and offshore.\u201d \n\n Modern, digital technologies are changing the way BHGE works with its customers and the outcomes it delivers. The company is helping to re-invent how work gets done and deliver radical efficiencies across the value chain, as demonstrated by a partnership with Shell. \n\n BHGE has jointly developed JewelSuite, which is revolutionizing the way Shell executes field development planning by integrating data and workflows from seismic interpretation all the way through to geological modelling. This allows Shell to reduce uncertainties on well placement, reserves estimation, and production planning. \n\n \u201cDigital Technologies have been an important feature in our industry for years but now the pace of change is increasing dramatically. What used to take years or months to be developed and deployed, can now take only weeks,\u201d said Harry Brekelmans, Director Shell Projects and Technology. \n\n BHGE also announced two deals that further underline the company\u2019s leadership in gas technologies. \n\n A contract with Maersk Oil will see BHGE deliver an integrated scope of turbomachinery equipment for the topside production facility of the Tyra field redevelopment project, in the Danish North Sea, including seven compression trains featuring BCL centrifugal compressors driven by GE Power high speed electric motors; three gas turbine generator sets; and two turbo expanders. The compressor technology uses an active magnetic bearing (AMB) solution for both driver and driven equipment, and BHGE will supply AMB applications through a license-based partnership with SKF, a leading player in the development, manufacture and sale of active magnetic bearings and magnetic bearing control technologies. Adopting an AMB and high-speed electric motor configuration provides Maersk with an optimized, oil-less solution that eliminates lubricant materials and reduces the weight, footprint and maintenance costs for the equipment on the platform\u2019s topside. \n\n On the power generation side, BHGE will supply the aeroderivative gas turbine, which is derived directly from GE Aviation\u2019s aircraft engines and is a lighter, compact and more efficient option. The equipment will be manufactured, packaged and tested in the BHGE Turbomachinery & Process Solutions centers of excellence of Florence, Italy and Le Creusot, France.\u00a0 \n\n Underlining its leadership in providing industry-leading gas turbine technology, BHGE is delivering 10 NovaLT16 gas turbines for customers in the APAC region. The latest deal will see BHGE supply the turbine to Vietsovpetro, the first time the proven technology will be deployed in an offshore environment in Vietnam. \n\n The country continues to have significant levels of oil and gas development both onshore and offshore, with increasing demand from power plants, refineries and petrochemical plants. The NovaLT16 \u2013 designed for both onshore and offshore applications \u2013 provides an efficient solution with a strong emphasis on high availability and reliability, while reducing operating costs. It will be combined with the gas compression platform\u2019s existing gas engine-driven reciprocating compressors to expand gas compression capacity at Block 09-1. The turbine is designed for both mechanical drive and power generation applications and, for this development, its mechanical drive capabilities are ideally suited to enhance the facility\u2019s gas compression performance, with 89% or higher compressor efficiency.\u00a0 \n\n Developed and built in Florence, Italy, the turbine can operate for up to 35,000 hours between maintenance intervals and has been configured to ensure servicing activities can be completed quickly and efficiently, thereby reducing downtime, resulting in high levels of reliability, availability and efficiency, with reduced operating costs for the customer. \n\n Visit https://www.bhge.com/annual-meeting to learn more about the Florence event including the conference agenda and speakers guide, and where the full proceedings from the Annual Meeting will be shared at the close of the event. \n\n \u00a0 \n\n "},
